# Changelog

All notable changes to Steps of Babylon are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Phase A — Foundation (2026-05-07, all 9 PRs merged)
- **A.2** Added `junit-vintage-engine` to test classpath — recovered 9 previously-hidden Robolectric tests (`RoomSchemaTest`, `DeepLinkRoutingTest`, `StepWidgetProviderTest`). Each needed `@Config(sdk = [34], application = android.app.Application::class)` as a Robolectric 4.14.1 / compileSdk 36 workaround.
- **A.3** `DatabaseKeyManager` now deletes the on-disk DB file (plus -shm/-wal) when the passphrase blob fails to decrypt, preventing crash-on-launch loops after device restore.
- **A.6** `DailyStepManager.runFollowOnPipeline` now forwards `seasonPassActive` / `seasonPassExpiry` to `TrackDailyLogin`, so the +10 Gems/day Season Pass bonus is credited even when step ingestion runs from the worker or background service.
- **A.5** `Screen.fromRoute` + `argumentFreeRoutes` whitelist — deep-links now reach all 12 argument-free routes (previously: 4). Unknown routes fall through silently.
- **A.4** `FakeBillingManager` / `FakeRewardAdManager` gained `resultQueue` scripting, configurable `isAdRemoved`/`isSeasonPassActive`/`isAdAvailable`, and call-log history. Store / Cards ViewModel tests now exercise every `PurchaseResult` / `AdResult` variant.
- **A.7** Capped Battle Step kills no longer spawn a misleading "+N Step" FloatingText. Callback signature changed to `(amount, x, y)` and spawn responsibility moved from GameEngine into BattleViewModel's callback.
- **A.8** Removed dead `PlaceholderScreen` and 4 orphaned imports from `MainActivity.kt`.
- **A.9** Deleted unused `SupplyDropTrigger.STEP_BURST` enum entry (no producer, no Room rows, no tests). Commit body preserves the original notification copy.
- **A.1** Current-state docs synced to DB schema v8 and 453-test baseline.

### Phase B.1 — Core Refactoring (2026-05-07, TimeProvider narrow migration)
- **B.1 PR 1** Added `TimeProvider` interface in `domain/time/` with `now(): Instant` and `today(): LocalDate`. Production `SystemTimeProvider` in `data/time/`, Hilt wiring in `di/TimeModule.kt`.
- **B.1 PR 2** Migrated 3 date-reading sites to a `timeProvider` default-arg parameter: `AwardBattleSteps`, `BattleViewModel`, `MissionsViewModel`. ~50 other wall-clock sites left on the real clock by design — narrow migration, not a sweep.
- **B.1 PR 3** Added `FakeTimeProvider` and 2 midnight-boundary tests that were previously impossible to write against the real clock. BattleViewModel now propagates its `timeProvider` into the inline `AwardBattleSteps` construction so the abstraction is end-to-end.
- ADR-0004 FollowOnPipeline stub recorded (status: Proposed, upgrade to Accepted when B.4 PR 1 lands).

### Phase B.2 — RO-02 atomic multi-writes (2026-05-07, PRs 1–3 of 5)
- **B.2 PR 1** `PurchaseUpgrade` now commits through `WorkshopDao.purchaseUpgradeAtomic` — a suspend `@Transaction` default interface method that takes `PlayerProfileDao` as a param. SQL-guarded deduct `UPDATE … WHERE currentStepBalance >= :cost` plus the workshop-level upsert runs in a single SQLite transaction. Closes the partial-failure gap between `spendSteps` and `setUpgradeLevel` and the double-tap race where two concurrent purchases could both pass an in-memory affordability check and double-spend. `PurchaseUpgrade` dropped its `PlayerRepository` dep; body shrank to a single delegation. First `@Transaction` marker in `app/src/main`.
- **B.2 PR 2** `AwardBattleSteps` now commits through `DailyStepDao.creditBattleStepsAtomic` — same pattern as PR 1, cross-DAO `@Transaction` default method taking `PlayerProfileDao`. Cap check + `incrementBattleSteps` + `adjustStepBalance` wrapped atomically. Closes the partial-failure gap (wallet credited without cap counter advancing) and the concurrent-kill race (two kills with 1 headroom could overflow by 1). `AwardBattleSteps` dropped its `PlayerRepository` dep; `BattleViewModel` gained a Hilt-injected `PlayerProfileDao`.
- **B.2 PR 3** `StepCrossValidator` wraps its 5 multi-write branches (Level 3 / Level 2 cap-excess, Level 1 / Level 0 first-escrow, reconciliation release) in `AppDatabase.withTransaction { }`. Different idiom from PRs 1–2 (repo-level not DAO-level) because the validator lives in `data/healthconnect/` and needs parallel transaction scopes; RO-02 explicitly licenses the cross-layer `AppDatabase` import here. Introduced a test-friendly `@VisibleForTesting internal var runInTransaction` seam so existing Mockito-based tests keep working without a real Room DB. `SharedPreferences` anti-cheat writes (`recordCvOffense`, `decayCvOffenses`) deliberately stay outside the transaction (not SQLite-backed).
- **B.2 PRs 4–5 still pending:** `ClaimMilestone` atomic (same pattern as PRs 1–2) and the `runEndRoundPersistence` `@Transaction` wrap (single-call-site change thanks to B.3 PR 1).

### Phase B.3 PR 1 — Resilient `runEndRoundPersistence` (2026-05-07)
- Extracted `BattleViewModel.endRound` body into a private suspend `runEndRoundPersistence(eng, wave)`. Each of 5 writes + 1 notification is wrapped in its own `runCatching { }.onFailure { Log.w(TAG, "endRound: <writeName> failed", it) }` so a single Room / notification-manager exception can no longer leave the player on a frozen battle screen with no post-round overlay.
- Writes whose results feed `RoundEndState` (`updateBestWave` → isNewBestWave/previousBest, `awardWaveMilestone` → psAwarded, `checkTierUnlock` + `updateHighestUnlockedTier` → tierUnlocked) use `.getOrNull()` / `.getOrDefault(0)` fallbacks, so the `_uiState.update` push **always** runs — even when every write throws.
- Writes 4–5 (`incrementBattleStats`, `dailyMissionDao.updateProgress`) moved from ad-hoc `try / catch (_: Exception) { /* best-effort */ }` swallows to `runCatching + Log.w` for observability parity with the R2-07 `StepSyncWorker` precedent.
- `endRound()` shrank from ~35 lines to 6 (guard + null-check + `viewModelScope.launch { runEndRoundPersistence(eng, wave) }`). `quitRound()` and the polling-loop call site unchanged; `roundEnded` guard still dedupes.
- `FakePlayerRepository` opened up (`class` → `open class`; 4 write methods marked `open override`) so tests can inject per-method throwing overrides to exercise the failure-isolation paths.
- `onCleared` mid-navigation round-loss fix is deliberately deferred to B.3 PR 2 per the RO-03 spec.

### Phase B.2 PR 4 — Atomic @Transaction for ClaimMilestone (2026-05-08)
- **MilestoneDao** gained `claimMilestoneAtomic(milestoneId, gems, powerStones, claimedAt, playerDao)` — a suspend `@Transaction` default method. Read-modify-write pattern matches `DailyStepDao.creditBattleStepsAtomic`: check existing → bail if already claimed → `upsert(MilestoneEntity(claimed=true, claimedAt))` → credit gems + power stones via `playerDao.adjustGems` + `incrementGemsEarned` (and Power Stones equivalents) inside the tx. Closes the partial-failure gap between reward credits and the mark-claimed write, and the double-claim race where two concurrent clicks could both see `claimed=false` and both credit.
- **ClaimMilestone** use case: dep shape `(milestoneDao, playerRepository)` → `(milestoneDao, playerRepository, playerProfileDao)`. Still reads `totalStepsEarned` through `PlayerRepository` (monotonic read, safe outside the tx). Body shrank from reward-iteration loop + upsert to a single atomic delegation. `MilestoneReward.Cosmetic` still a no-op pending C.4 detection fix.
- **MissionsViewModel** gained a Hilt-injected `PlayerProfileDao`. **FakeMilestoneDao** gained optional `linkedPlayer: FakePlayerRepository? = null` + Mutex-guarded `claimMilestoneAtomic` override + `claimMilestoneAtomicCallCount` counter. Existing no-arg construction sites (CheckMilestonesTest, HomeViewModelTest) stay source-compatible.
- **ClaimMilestoneTest**: 5 → 8 cases (+3 RO-02 atomicity cases).

### Phase B.2 PR 5 — Room @Transaction around runEndRoundPersistence (2026-05-08, FINAL RO-02 site)
- **BattleViewModel.runEndRoundPersistence** now commits its 5 SQLite writes (`updateBestWave`, `awardWaveMilestone`, `updateHighestUnlockedTier`, `incrementBattleStats`, `dailyMissionDao.updateProgress`) inside a single `AppDatabase.withTransaction { }` block. External readers (Flow-based reactive reads) now see either the pre-PR state or the post-PR state, never a partial fan-out.
- Constructor grew to 12 params (+`AppDatabase`). Introduced `@VisibleForTesting internal var runInTransaction` seam matching `StepCrossValidator`'s B.2 PR 3 idiom — Mockito mocks of `AppDatabase` can't run Room's `withTransaction` extension, so tests override with a direct-invocation pass-through.
- Non-SQLite side effects (milestone notification, `_uiState.update`) moved to *after* the tx — no DB lock held across Android system calls or UI pushes.
- Outer `runCatching { runInTransaction { ... } }` preserves RO-03 resilience: Room infrastructure failures (disk full, SQLCipher decrypt failure) still let the post-round overlay appear with safe defaults (`isNewBestWave = false`, etc).
- **RO-02 family complete: 5/5 sites landed** (3 DAO-level `@Transaction` + 2 repo-level `withTransaction`).
- **BattleViewModelTest**: 19 → 21 cases (+2 atomicity cases: tx opened exactly once per round; UI push runs AFTER tx commits).

### Phase B.3 PR 2 — onCleared guard preserves mid-nav round progress (2026-05-08, FINAL RO-03 site)
- **New `di/CoroutineScopeModule.kt`** with `@ApplicationScope` qualifier + `@Singleton @Provides fun provideApplicationScope(): CoroutineScope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Default)`. Outlives VM cancellation — fire-and-forget work launched here completes even if the originating ViewModel is cleared mid-operation.
- **Deviation from RO-03 spec** (documented in the module's KDoc): spec suggested `ProcessLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope`, but (a) `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-process` isn't on the classpath, (b) its default dispatcher is `Dispatchers.Main` — wrong for DB writes, (c) Hilt-injected scope is more testable (`TestScope`-backed), (d) matches the project's Hilt-first conventions (BillingModule / AdModule / TimeModule precedent).
- **BattleViewModel**: +`@param:ApplicationScope applicationScope: CoroutineScope` (12 → 13 params). Extracted `markEndedAndLaunchPersistence(scope, eng)` helper that sets `roundEnded + roundOver` and launches `runEndRoundPersistence` on the provided scope; `endRound()` delegates via `viewModelScope`, new `onCleared()` override delegates via `applicationScope` when `engine != null && !roundEnded && engine.hasWaveProgress()`. Three-way guard prevents bounce-through phantom persistence and double-persistence on the normal `quitRound → onCleared` sequence.
- **GameEngine.hasWaveProgress()**: `elapsedTimeSeconds > 0f || totalEnemiesKilled > 0`. Thread-safe (reads `@Volatile` fields only).
- **RO-03 family complete: 2/2 sites landed** (B.3 PR 1 resilient extraction + B.3 PR 2 mid-nav scope guard).
- **BattleViewModelTest**: 21 → 24 cases (+3 B.3 PR 2 tests: mid-round onCleared persists, no-progress bounce-through is no-op, post-quitRound onCleared is no-op).
- Fixed the `@ApplicationScope` → `@param:ApplicationScope` forward-compat warning (Kotlin KT-73255) on the same PR for clean build.

### Phase C.2 PR 1 — Cosmetic renderer override pipeline (2026-05-08, RO-07 plumbing)
- **CosmeticItem** domain model: +`overrideColors: List<Int>? = null` nullable field. Pure Kotlin (no Android imports in domain). All existing construction sites stay source-compatible.
- **CosmeticRepositoryImpl**: +private `ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP: Map<String, List<Int>>` empty map + KDoc (first entry ships in C.2 PR 2 with ZIG_JADE). `toDomain` populates `overrideColors = ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP[cosmeticId]`. No DB schema change — colors are content, live in code.
- **GameEngine**: +`@Volatile var cosmeticOverrides: Map<CosmeticCategory, CosmeticItem> = emptyMap()` public property. In `init()`, selects `cosmeticOverrides[ZIGGURAT_SKIN]?.overrideColors ?: biomeTheme.zigguratColors` when constructing ZigguratEntity — null-coalesce guarantees no regression when no cosmetic equipped.
- **BattleViewModel** constructor grew to 14 params (+`CosmeticRepository`). Loads equipped cosmetics in the init launch (`cosmeticRepository.observeEquipped().first().associateBy { it.category }`) and pushes to `engine?.cosmeticOverrides` in TWO places: init-launch completion and `startPollingEngine` — idempotent double-push handles the load-vs-attach race; whichever fires last wins.
- Pure additive plumbing. No user-visible change until C.2 PR 2 seeds ZIG_JADE + removes the R2-11 "Coming Soon" guard for that single ID in StoreScreen.
- **BattleViewModelTest**: 24 → 26 cases (+2 C.2 PR 1 tests: empty equipped set stays empty on engine; equipped ZIGGURAT_SKIN cosmetic propagates to `engine.cosmeticOverrides`).

### Phase C.2 PR 2 — Seed zig_jade as first end-to-end cosmetic (2026-05-08, RO-07 content)
- **CosmeticRepositoryImpl**: `ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP` populated with its first entry — `"zig_jade"` mapped to the 5-color jade palette `[0xFF104E3C, 0xFF1A6B52, 0xFF2A8F6E, 0xFF3CAB82, 0xFF54C79A]` (bottom layer → top highlight). Matches the fixture used by the PR 1 synthetic VM→engine test.
- **SEED_COSMETICS**: +1 row — `CosmeticEntity(cosmeticId = "zig_jade", category = "ZIGGURAT_SKIN", name = "Jade Ziggurat", description = "Deep jade stone with pale highlights", priceGems = 150)`. Placed first in the list so it surfaces at the top of the Store cosmetics section. Total seed count: 7 → 8 (4 ZIGGURAT_SKIN, 2 PROJECTILE_EFFECT, 2 ENEMY_SKIN).
- **StoreScreen**: R2-11 "Coming Soon" guard lifted for `zig_jade` only via a new file-level `ENABLED_COSMETIC_ID` allow-list const. Unowned jade shows `💎 {priceGems}` on an enabled Button wired to `viewModel.purchaseCosmetic`, disabled while `state.isPurchasing` (double-tap guard). All other unowned cosmetics stay behind the existing "Coming Soon" disabled button until their palette ships in C.2 PR 3+. Disclaimer line updated: "Most cosmetic visuals are still being finalized. Jade Ziggurat is available now."
- **FakeCosmeticDao**: new in-memory fake (`test/fakes/`, 75 LOC) simulating Room's `@PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)` via a monotonic counter, plus per-cosmeticId upsert / equip / unequip / unequipCategory semantics matching the real DAO contract.
- **CosmeticRepositoryImplTest**: new (`test/data/repository/`, 134 LOC, 5 cases) proves the `seed → ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP → CosmeticItem.overrideColors` chain on the real impl — the last mile of the C.2 pipeline that PR 1's VM test could not cover with a fake repo. Cases: (1) `ensureSeedData` inserts `zig_jade` with correct metadata; (2) `zig_jade.overrideColors` matches the 5-color jade palette exactly (content-as-code contract); (3) other 7 seeds have `null` overrideColors (regression guard: lookup is selective, not blanket); (4) equipped `zig_jade` surfaces via `observeEquipped` with palette intact — repo-layer mirror of the PR 1 VM→engine test; (5) `ensureSeedData` idempotent on repeat call (documents the current all-or-nothing `dao.count() > 0` gate).
- **480 tests** (475 → 480 via the 5 new repo-layer cases). Zero balance-math changes.
- **Known debt flagged for release:** `ensureSeedData` currently short-circuits when `dao.count() > 0`, so future content PRs (C.2 PR 3+) that add new seed rows won't land on already-seeded installs without a data clear. Acceptable for pre-release; must be replaced with per-cosmeticId upsert logic (or a DB migration) before v1.0.

### Phase C.4 — ClaimMilestone UnknownCosmetic detection (2026-05-08, RO-07 follow-up)
- **ClaimMilestone**: return type `Boolean` → `ClaimMilestoneResult` sealed class with four variants — `Success` (atomic credit ran), `InsufficientSteps` (step threshold unmet), `AlreadyClaimed` (atomic DAO returned false), `UnknownCosmetic(cosmeticId)` (one of the milestone's `MilestoneReward.Cosmetic` ids has no matching row in `SEED_COSMETICS`). Pre-flight check runs BEFORE the atomic DAO call so no partial credit when a cosmetic id is unknown. Constructor grew to 4 params (+`CosmeticRepository`).
- **CosmeticRepository**: +`suspend fun idExists(cosmeticId: String): Boolean` on the domain interface. Real impl lazy-seeds via `ensureSeedData()` then queries `observeAll().first().any { it.cosmeticId == cosmeticId }`; `FakeCosmeticRepository` checks its `items` StateFlow directly. KDoc on the interface documents the C.4 detection-only rationale and flags resolution as C.2 PR 3+ content work.
- **MissionsViewModel**: gained a Hilt-injected `CosmeticRepository` (7 constructor params). `claimMilestone(milestone)` now pattern-matches `ClaimMilestoneResult` and surfaces non-Success outcomes as user-visible snackbar messages via a new `userMessage: StateFlow<String?>` + `clearMessage()` method. The `combine()` grew from 4 to 5 flows (+userMessage). `MissionsUiState` gained `userMessage: String?` field with KDoc.
- **MissionsScreen**: wrapped in `Scaffold(snackbarHost = { SnackbarHost(…) })` with a `LaunchedEffect(state.userMessage)` that shows the snackbar and clears. First time Missions gets user feedback on failed claims (previously silent).
- **User-visible impact today:** the 3 currently-mismatched milestone cosmetic ids (`garden_ziggurat_skin` on MARATHON_WALKER, `lapis_lazuli_skin` on IRON_SOLES, `sandals_of_gilgamesh` on GLOBE_TROTTER) now surface as a snackbar ("Reward temporarily unavailable …") instead of silently dropping. Those 3 milestones cannot be claimed until C.2 PR 3+ adds matching seed rows; until then the claim rejects cleanly with zero partial credit.
- **ClaimMilestoneTest**: 8 → 12 cases (-1 merged + 5 new). Removed the old `credits Gems and Power Stones for IRON_SOLES` success-path case; coverage preserved by (a) new `UnknownCosmetic surfaces offending cosmetic id for IRON_SOLES` (default-state UnknownCosmetic rejection) + (b) new `milestone with matching cosmetic id credits rewards via atomic path` (seeds a `lapis_lazuli_skin` cosmetic fixture and shows the atomic credit runs cleanly, emulating post-C.2-PR-3 state). Renamed 3 cases for Result-type clarity. Switched the concurrent-claims race target from IRON_SOLES (unknown cosmetic) to MORNING_JOGGER (Gems-only) so the atomicity invariant being tested is independent of the cosmetic-id pre-flight check. 4 new C.4 cases: `UnknownCosmetic` x 3 (one per mismatched milestone, asserting the exact offending id), `UnknownCosmetic rejects claim before the atomic DAO call with no credit` (regression guard on the pre-flight ordering).
- **MissionsViewModelTest**: direct `ClaimMilestone` construction updated to 4-arg (+`FakeCosmeticRepository()`); asserts `ClaimMilestoneResult.Success` on the FIRST_STEPS claim path.
- **484 tests** (480 → 484 via +4 net). Zero balance-math changes.

### Fix — `ensureSeedData` per-cosmeticId filter (2026-05-08)
- **CosmeticRepositoryImpl.ensureSeedData**: replaced the all-or-nothing `if (dao.count() > 0) return` short-circuit with a per-`cosmeticId` filter. Reads existing ids once via `observeAll().first().mapTo(HashSet())`, computes `missing = SEED_COSMETICS.filter { it.cosmeticId !in existingIds }`, and `upsertAll(missing)` only when non-empty. Three behaviours:
  - **Fresh install:** `existingIds` empty → every SEED_COSMETICS row inserted. Identical to pre-fix behaviour.
  - **Partial-catalogue upgrade:** device already has the pre-`zig_jade` 7-row catalogue → only `zig_jade` inserted; 7 legacy rows untouched. Before the fix, this case was broken (count > 0 short-circuit skipped everything), so `zig_jade` never landed on already-installed devs without a data clear.
  - **Steady state:** all ids present → `missing` empty → no DAO write. Same as before, different mechanism.
- **Why the filter instead of a universal upsert:** `CosmeticEntity`'s primary key is `id` (auto-gen), not `cosmeticId`. Re-upserting a seed row with `id = 0` would insert a new auto-gen row alongside the existing one, not replace it. The explicit filter sidesteps that entirely by never handing already-present rows to the DAO.
- **Unblocks C.2 PR 3+** (the 3 milestone cosmetic seed rows that resolve the C.4 UnknownCosmetic detections): content PRs can now land on any install regardless of its catalogue history. Also removes the "data clear required" friction for any dev who installed a pre-C.2-PR-2 debug build.
- **Tests:** CosmeticRepositoryImplTest gained 2 regression-guard cases:
  - `ensureSeedData inserts newly-added rows on partial catalogue upgrade` — pre-seeds 7 legacy rows manually (no `zig_jade`), asserts `ensureSeedData` inserts `zig_jade` with its `ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP` palette and leaves the 7 legacy rows intact.
  - `ensureSeedData preserves player state on existing rows (isOwned, isEquipped)` — pre-seeds `zig_jade` with `isOwned=true, isEquipped=true`, runs `ensureSeedData`, asserts the player state survives (never overwritten because the filter skips the row entirely).
  Existing idempotency test renamed (removed "count gate holds" phrase); end-state assertion unchanged because the filter produces the same steady-state behaviour via a different mechanism.
- **486 tests** (484 → 486). Zero balance-math changes.

### Phase C.2 PR 3 — Seed `lapis_lazuli_skin` (IRON_SOLES milestone reward) (2026-05-08)
- **CosmeticRepositoryImpl.SEED_COSMETICS**: +1 row — `CosmeticEntity(cosmeticId = "lapis_lazuli_skin", category = "ZIGGURAT_SKIN", name = "Lapis Lazuli Ziggurat Skin", description = "Deep lapis lazuli stone with pyrite-gold flecks", priceGems = 500)`. Placed second in the list (directly after `zig_jade`) so the two palette-shipping cosmetics appear grouped at the top of the Store section. Intentionally NOT added to `StoreScreen.ENABLED_COSMETIC_ID` — still shows "Coming Soon" in the Store; primary acquisition path is the IRON_SOLES milestone claim. Store pricing is a future UX decision. Total seed count: 8 → 9.
- **ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP**: +1 entry — `"lapis_lazuli_skin"` maps to `[0xFF1A1F5C, 0xFF2A3880, 0xFF3B4FAB, 0xFF4F68C8, 0xFFD4A84A]` (bottom → top: deep lapis base → bright lapis → pyrite-gold crown). The gold crown is the traditional pyrite-fleck reference that distinguishes lapis lazuli from plain blue stone. Same 5-int / layer-ordered contract as the `zig_jade` palette (C.2 PR 2).
- **Resolves C.4 UnknownCosmetic for IRON_SOLES**: `CosmeticRepository.idExists("lapis_lazuli_skin")` now returns `true`, so `ClaimMilestone(Milestone.IRON_SOLES)` passes the pre-flight cosmetic-id check and runs the atomic credit (200 Gems + 50 Power Stones). Before this PR, IRON_SOLES claims returned `UnknownCosmetic("lapis_lazuli_skin")` and rejected cleanly; post-PR, they return `Success`.
- **ClaimMilestoneTest**: rewired 12 → 11 cases. Removed `UnknownCosmetic surfaces offending cosmetic id for IRON_SOLES` (prod semantics flipped — lapis_lazuli_skin is now seeded, IRON_SOLES no longer returns UnknownCosmetic). Switched `UnknownCosmetic rejects claim before the atomic DAO call with no credit` to target MARATHON_WALKER (garden_ziggurat_skin still unknown) so the test reflects prod behaviour. Rewrote the former `milestone with matching cosmetic id credits rewards via atomic path` as `IRON_SOLES claim succeeds end-to-end via real CosmeticRepositoryImpl` — uses `CosmeticRepositoryImpl(FakeCosmeticDao())` instead of a `FakeCosmeticRepository` fixture, proving the full `SEED_COSMETICS → ensureSeedData → idExists → ClaimMilestone atomic credit → wallet` chain on the real implementation.
- **CosmeticRepositoryImplTest**: updated 7 → 8 cases. +1 new `C2PR3 - lapis_lazuli_skin propagates lapis palette via overrideColors from ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP` with exact-value palette assertion matching the `zig_jade` pattern (content-as-code contract). Updated `ensureSeedData is idempotent` count assertion 8 → 9. Updated `ensureSeedData inserts newly-added rows on partial catalogue upgrade` count 8 → 9 with a new lapis palette check alongside the existing jade one (proves both palettes land on the same upgrade path). Updated `ensureSeedData preserves player state on existing rows` count 8 → 9. Updated the `other seeded ziggurat cosmetics have null overrideColors` comment to reflect that both `zig_jade` (PR 2) and `lapis_lazuli_skin` (PR 3) now ship palettes.
- **486 tests, unchanged count** (-1 ClaimMilestoneTest removed case + 1 CosmeticRepositoryImplTest new lapis palette case = 0 net). Zero balance-math changes.
- **Next up (C.2 PR 3b / 3c):** `garden_ziggurat_skin` (MARATHON_WALKER, 600 Gems) and `sandals_of_gilgamesh` (GLOBE_TROTTER, 500 Gems). Each PR will flip one more `UnknownCosmetic` detection to `Success`. After all 3 land, all 6 Milestone entries are fully claimable end-to-end — closes the "shipped but disabled" monetization gap that has been tracked since Plan R2-11.

### Phase C.2 PR 3b + 3c — Seed remaining milestone cosmetics (MARATHON_WALKER + GLOBE_TROTTER) (2026-05-08)
- **CosmeticRepositoryImpl.SEED_COSMETICS**: +2 rows — `garden_ziggurat_skin` (ZIGGURAT_SKIN, 600 Gems, MARATHON_WALKER reward) and `sandals_of_gilgamesh` (ZIGGURAT_SKIN, 500 Gems, GLOBE_TROTTER reward). Total seed count: 9 → 11. Both placed directly after `lapis_lazuli_skin` so the 4 palette-shipping cosmetics appear as a block at the top of the catalogue. Neither is in `StoreScreen.ENABLED_COSMETIC_ID` — both are milestone-acquisition-only, still show "Coming Soon" in the Store.
- **ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP**: +2 palettes.
  - `garden_ziggurat_skin`: `[0xFF8B4726, 0xFFAD7B4C, 0xFF5E7F47, 0xFF7BA85A, 0xFFE0C890]` — Hanging Gardens biome theme. Terracotta ziggurat base → sun-bleached sandstone → mossy vines → lush foliage → pale bloom canopy. Evokes the stone structure overtaken by cascading gardens.
  - `sandals_of_gilgamesh`: `[0xFF3B2A1A, 0xFF6B4A2A, 0xFF8B6B42, 0xFFB89152, 0xFFE8C068]` — weathered bronze → polished bronze → gold crown. Heroic motif; the gold crown echoes `lapis_lazuli_skin` as a shared "legendary" visual cue.
- **Category decision for `sandals_of_gilgamesh`:** the id carries footwear semantics ("walking the edges of the world") but the cosmetic is implemented as a `ZIGGURAT_SKIN` — a bronze Gilgamesh-themed ziggurat variant. Kept the existing category + pipeline intact (no new `CosmeticCategory` enum value, no schema change, no new rendering path). Description text ("Bronze ziggurat in honour of Gilgamesh, whose sandals walked the edges of the world") bridges the name-vs-implementation gap. Revisit a `PLAYER_AVATAR` category only if future milestones introduce multiple player-avatar cosmetics.
- **Resolves the remaining 2 C.4 UnknownCosmetic detections**: `ClaimMilestone(MARATHON_WALKER)` now returns `Success` (600 Gems credited); `ClaimMilestone(GLOBE_TROTTER)` now returns `Success` (500 Gems credited). Combined with C.2 PR 3 (IRON_SOLES), all 3 previously-mismatched milestone cosmetic ids are fixed. **All 6 Milestone entries now claim cleanly end-to-end.**
- **ClaimMilestoneTest**: 11 → 11 cases (net 0: -2 + 2). Removed both `UnknownCosmetic surfaces offending cosmetic id for MARATHON_WALKER` and `... for GLOBE_TROTTER` (prod semantics flipped to Success for both). Kept the `UnknownCosmetic rejects claim before the atomic DAO call with no credit` synthetic regression guard (still uses MARATHON_WALKER against the empty fake — no prod Milestone currently reaches this rejection path, but the guard protects against future content work introducing a new Milestone with an unseeded Cosmetic reward). Setup comment rewritten to reflect: no more prod mismatches. Added `MARATHON_WALKER claim succeeds end-to-end via real CosmeticRepositoryImpl` + `GLOBE_TROTTER claim succeeds end-to-end via real CosmeticRepositoryImpl` — same shape as the existing IRON_SOLES test. Together with the IRON_SOLES test, every Milestone with a Cosmetic reward has a dedicated end-to-end success test.
- **CosmeticRepositoryImplTest**: 8 → 10 cases (+2). Added `C2PR3b - garden_ziggurat_skin propagates hanging-gardens palette` + `C2PR3c - sandals_of_gilgamesh propagates bronze-ziggurat palette`, each with exact-value palette assertion matching the `zig_jade` / `lapis_lazuli_skin` pattern (content-as-code contract). Updated all 3 count assertions (9 → 11): idempotency, partial-catalogue upgrade (now verifies all 4 palette-shipping cosmetics land correctly on the same upgrade path), existing-row preservation. Updated the `other seeded ziggurat cosmetics have null overrideColors` comment to list all 4 palette cosmetics.
- **488 tests** (486 → 488 via +2 net). Zero balance-math changes.
- **Monetization gap closed.** The RO-07 "shipped but disabled" cosmetic gap that has been tracked since Plan R2-11 is fully resolved: renderer pipeline live (C.2 PR 1), first store cosmetic live (C.2 PR 2 `zig_jade`), all 3 milestone cosmetics live (C.2 PR 3 / 3b / 3c), UnknownCosmetic detection still guards against regressions (C.4), `ensureSeedData` lands new rows on any install (fix). Players who hit IRON_SOLES / MARATHON_WALKER / GLOBE_TROTTER now get their full rewards atomically.

### Current state
- **488 JVM tests** green (412 baseline → 453 after Phase A → 455 after B.1 → 458 after B.2 PR 1 → 461 after B.3 PR 1 → 463 after B.2 PR 2 → 465 after B.2 PR 3 → 468 after B.2 PR 4 → 470 after B.2 PR 5 → 473 after B.3 PR 2 → 475 after C.2 PR 1 → 480 after C.2 PR 2 → 484 after C.4 → 486 after ensureSeedData fix → 486 after C.2 PR 3 → 488 after C.2 PR 3b+3c). Zero balance-math changes across all of Phase B and Phase C.
- Plan 31 (Play Console & Store Publication) remains the only release-blocker; unblocked since the end of Plan R2.
- **RO-02 complete: 5/5 atomic sites landed** (`PurchaseUpgrade`, `AwardBattleSteps`, `StepCrossValidator`, `ClaimMilestone`, `runEndRoundPersistence`).
- **RO-03 complete: 2/2 resilience sites landed** (extraction + `onCleared` guard).
- **RO-07 complete for the milestone-cosmetic gap: C.2 PRs 1+2+3+3b+3c + C.4 + ensureSeedData fix landed.** All 6 Milestone entries claim cleanly end-to-end. Only 3 of 7 seeded ziggurat skins ship palettes (the 3 milestone rewards + `zig_jade`); the 3 original placeholder skins (`zig_obsidian`, `zig_crystal`, `zig_golden`) + 4 non-ziggurat seeds (`proj_*`, `enemy_*`) remain "Coming Soon" in the Store until their visual content is designed.
- Real Billing/Ad SDK swaps (Phase C.5/C.6) still gated on ADR-0005/ADR-0006 — now the top release-critical item.
- B.4 (FollowOnPipeline extraction) + B.5 (UpdateMissionProgress use case) remain as pure debt, not release blockers.
