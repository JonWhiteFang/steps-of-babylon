# Changelog

All notable changes to Steps of Babylon are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### R3-03: COMPLETE_RESEARCH mission false-trigger fix (2026-05-19)

Fixes [GitHub issue #1](https://github.com/JonWhiteFang/steps-of-babylon/issues/1). Opening the Labs screen with no in-flight research previously advanced the daily COMPLETE_RESEARCH mission to progress=1, completed=true regardless of whether anything actually completed.

**Bug shape.** `LabsViewModel.init` ran a coroutine that called `labRepository.ensureResearchExists()`, then `checkCompletion()`, then `updateResearchMission()` unconditionally. The private `updateResearchMission()` helper looked up today's COMPLETE_RESEARCH mission row and called `dailyMissionDao.updateProgress(m.id, 1, true)` whenever a row was found and not already completed — ignoring the actual return value of `CheckResearchCompletion`. Players reasonably interpreted this as the daily mission silently auto-completing the moment they opened Labs.

**Fix.** Extracted the mission-tick logic into a new `domain/usecase/UpdateCompleteResearchMissionProgress.kt` use case (matches the existing project convention for cross-layer use cases like `TrackDailyLogin`, `GenerateDailyMissions`). The new use case:

- Takes `DailyMissionDao` and exposes `invoke(completedCount: Int, today: String = LocalDate.now().toString())`.
- Gates the DAO write on `completedCount >= 1` (early return otherwise) — the entire R3-03 fix.
- Replaces the historical "always set to target, completed=true" write with an additive-with-cap increment: `newProgress = (m.progress + completedCount).coerceAtMost(m.target)`. For COMPLETE_RESEARCH the target is 1, so the clamp degenerates to the historical single-completion behaviour while gracefully handling multi-completion auto-batches (e.g. 3 expired research projects all auto-completing on app launch correctly count as one completed mission, not three increments overshooting the target).
- Preserves the prior fail-open contract: missing today's row, already-claimed, already-completed, and DAO exceptions are all silent no-ops.

All 3 LabsViewModel call sites updated to use the new use case with explicit counts: `init` passes `completed.size` from `CheckResearchCompletion`, `rushResearch` passes 1 on `Result.Rushed`, `freeRush` passes 1 after `labRepository.completeResearch(type)`. The now-redundant private `updateResearchMission()` helper and the `DailyMissionType` import were removed.

5 new tests in `app/src/test/java/com/whitefang/stepsofbabylon/domain/usecase/UpdateCompleteResearchMissionProgressTest.kt`:
- `R303 does NOT tick when completedCount is 0` (R3-03 acceptance — the negative case from issue #1)
- `R303 does NOT tick when completedCount is negative` (defensive guard against caller bugs)
- `R303 ticks to 1 when completedCount is 1` (positive: the auto-completion path on Labs entry)
- `R303 caps progress at target when multiple research complete in one batch` (regression guard against the additive math overshooting)
- `R303 is a no-op when no mission row exists for the given date` (defensive: idempotency)

Why a separate use case rather than inlining `if (completed.isNotEmpty())` in `LabsViewModel.init`? Three reasons. First, it keeps the gating in one testable place — anyone calling the use case (current 3 call sites + any future entry point) gets the gating for free, so the bug shape can't reappear at a different call site. Second, it avoids a hard test problem: `LabsViewModel.init` runs a `while(true) { delay(1000) }` ticker on `viewModelScope` (a separate `SupervisorJob` not reachable from the test scope), which makes any in-VM regression test that doesn't carefully cancel the scope hang `runTest`'s scheduler-drain forever. Third, it matches the project convention (`TrackDailyLogin(dailyLoginDao, playerRepository)`, `GenerateDailyMissions(dailyMissionDao)` etc. live as use cases that take DAOs).

Test count: 622 → 627 (+5). `./run-gradle.sh testDebugUnitTest` and `./run-gradle.sh bundleRelease` both BUILD SUCCESSFUL.

### R3-02: THORN_DAMAGE wiring + LIFESTEAL visibility (2026-05-19)

Fixes [GitHub issue #4](https://github.com/JonWhiteFang/steps-of-babylon/issues/4). Two related defects in the THORN_DAMAGE / LIFESTEAL Defense upgrades surfaced during the v5 internal-track on-device smoke test.

**THORN_DAMAGE never reflected damage.** `ResolvedStats.thornPercent` was correctly plumbed by `ResolveStats` (1 % per level) and consumed by `GameEngine.applyThorn` via `attacker.takeDamage(rawDamage * stats.thornPercent * conditions.thornMultiplier)`. But every call site of `applyDamageToZiggurat` passed `attacker = null`. The `EnemyEntity.onMeleeHit -> WaveSpawner.onMeleeHit -> GameEngine` callback chain was typed `(Double) -> Unit` and dropped the enemy reference, so `applyThorn` early-returned for every melee hit. Players saw zero reflected damage regardless of THORN_DAMAGE upgrade level.

**LIFESTEAL heal was imperceptible at low levels.** The math was correct (`zig.currentHp += damage * stats.lifestealPercent`, `Double`-typed so sub-1-HP heals are conserved), but at low levels the heal was sub-pixel: Lv 1 (0.2 % lifesteal) on base damage 10 = 0.02 HP per hit — an invisible HP-bar nudge users could not perceive.

**Fix — THORN:**
- Changed `EnemyEntity.onMeleeHit: ((Double) -> Unit)?` to `((EnemyEntity, Double) -> Unit)?`; `update()` invokes `onMeleeHit?.invoke(this, damage)` so consumers see the attacker.
- Changed `WaveSpawner.onMeleeHit: (Double) -> Unit` to `(EnemyEntity, Double) -> Unit`.
- Flipped 2 `GameEngine` call sites (initial `WaveSpawner` wiring + SCATTER child enemy spawn site) from `{ _, dmg -> applyDamageToZiggurat(dmg, null) }` to `{ atk, dmg -> applyDamageToZiggurat(dmg, atk) }` so `applyThorn` actually fires.
- Ranged-projectile path stays `null` per GDD wording 'damage reflected to attackers' — the firing enemy isn't the attacker, the projectile is, and projectiles aren't living entities.

**Fix — LIFESTEAL** (per `plan-R3-remediation-3.md` § R3-02 option (b)):
- Added `private var lifestealAccumulator: Double = 0.0` field on `GameEngine`, reset in `init()`.
- Extracted the existing in-place heal at `onProjectileHitEnemy` and `onOrbHitEnemy` into a new private `applyLifesteal(healAmount)` helper (mirrors `applyThorn`'s shape) that does math + accumulator + visible-text emit in one place.
- Each time the accumulator crosses an integer HP threshold a `FloatingText("+$visibleHp HP", STEP_COLOR)` indicator is queued above the ziggurat, mirroring the RECOVERY_PACKAGES feedback pattern.
- Math is identical to pre-R3-02; only the visible feedback is new. At cap (15 % × base damage 10 = 1.5 HP / hit) every shot emits `+1 HP`; at Lv 1 it takes ~50 hits to accumulate one visible burst, matching the expectation that low-level lifesteal is weak but observable.

3 new tests in `app/src/test/.../GameEngineTest.kt` under a new R3-02 section:
- `R302 THORN_DAMAGE reflects damage on melee hit via plumbed attacker reference`
- `R302 THORN_DAMAGE scales linearly with thornPercent` (direct value assertions catch the pre-fix degenerate case where both reflects are zero — 0 × 5 == 0 passes a ratio check trivially)
- `R302 LIFESTEAL emits visible floating text when accumulated heal crosses 1 HP`

Plus 5 reflective helpers: `freshEngineWithStats`, `invokeOnMeleeHit` (reads `WaveSpawner.onMeleeHit` field), `createDummyAttacker`, `invokeOnProjectileHitEnemy`, `readPendingFloatingTextSnippets`. `WaveSpawnerTest` updated to compile against the new 2-arg `onMeleeHit` signature.

Test count: 619 → 622 (+3). `./run-gradle.sh testDebugUnitTest` and `./run-gradle.sh bundleRelease` both BUILD SUCCESSFUL.

### R3-01: battle backgrounding state preservation (2026-05-19)

Fixes [GitHub issue #2](https://github.com/JonWhiteFang/steps-of-babylon/issues/2). Backgrounding the app mid-round (Recents, screen lock, incoming notification) previously wiped wave / cash / kills / `elapsedTimeSeconds` because `GameSurfaceView.surfaceCreated` and `surfaceChanged` unconditionally called `engine.init` on every Android lifecycle event, and the new `GameLoopThread` started with default `speedMultiplier = 1f` / `isPaused = false` because `setSpeedMultiplier` / `setPaused` wrote only to `gameThread` which was null between `surfaceDestroyed` and the next `surfaceCreated`.

Fix:
- Extracted `@VisibleForTesting internal fun GameSurfaceView.initEngineIfNeeded()` that gates `engine.init` on `!engine.hasWaveProgress()`. The `hasWaveProgress()` helper already existed (added by RO-03 / B.3 PR 2 for `BattleViewModel.onCleared` mid-nav persistence) — exactly the right signal at the wrong call site, now wired in.
- Added `@Volatile internal var pendingSpeed: Float = 1f` and `pendingPaused: Boolean = false` written by `setSpeedMultiplier` / `setPaused` alongside the live thread; `surfaceCreated` reads them when constructing the new thread so a recreated game loop inherits the player's UI selections.

4 new tests in `app/src/test/java/com/whitefang/stepsofbabylon/presentation/battle/GameSurfaceViewTest.kt` (Robolectric):
- `R3-01 surface recreation preserves engine progress mid-round`
- `R3-01 setSpeedMultiplier persists pendingSpeed for next thread`
- `R3-01 setPaused persists pendingPaused for next thread`
- `R3-01 initEngineIfNeeded does run engine init when no progress yet` (inverse / no-regression guard)

Deliberately deferred: `BattleScreen` `ON_RESUME` re-apply handler (defence in depth). With the `GameSurfaceView` fix the new thread always inherits correct state; the secondary handler would only matter if Compose dropped state across recomposition, which is hard to unit-test without a Compose harness.

Test count: 615 → 619 (+4). `./run-gradle.sh testDebugUnitTest` and `./run-gradle.sh bundleRelease` both BUILD SUCCESSFUL.

### Plan R3 scaffolding (2026-05-19)

The v5 internal-track on-device smoke test (2026-05-19 morning) surfaced 4 gameplay bugs filed as GitHub issues #1–#4 on `JonWhiteFang/steps-of-babylon`. This PR formalises the response as Plan R3 (Remediation 3) — the GitHub-issue-driven analog of the external-review-driven Plan R and Plan R2.

GitHub-side scaffolding (already live on the remote at the time of this commit):
- 11 new labels: `severity:blocker`, `severity:major`, `severity:minor`, `area:battle`, `area:missions`, `area:economy`, `area:billing`, `area:ui`, `needs-more-info`, `in-progress`, `regression-guard-needed`.
- New milestone `v1.0.0 closed-test gate` (#1) with all 4 open issues attached.
- `needs-more-info` clarification comment posted on issue #3 (7-day window).

Repo-side:
- New plan file `docs/plans/plan-R3-remediation-3.md` (182 lines, 4 sub-plans mirroring the R2 shape: Sub-Plan Index → Dependency Graph → per-sub-plan detail block → Execution Notes → Priority Tiers → Open Questions).
- `docs/plans/master-plan.md` and `AGENTS.md` updated to register R3 in the Plan Index, dependency graph, critical path, and Status checklist (master plan entry count 34 → 35).
- `docs/agent/STATE.md` and `docs/agent/RUN_LOG.md` updated.

No source / test / schema impact. Test count remains 615 at this commit.

### README audit + LICENSE creation (2026-05-19)

Follow-up to the docs-sweep PR earlier the same day. The user requested an audit of `README.md` for fitness-for-function. Audit found 10 gaps across P0–P3 severities; this PR lands all of them in a single pass plus a new `LICENSE` file. Pure-docs PR — no source / test / schema impact.

#### New file

- **`LICENSE`** (17 lines) — proprietary, all rights reserved. Copyright © 2026 Jon White Fang. Source code is proprietary; the compiled app is distributed via Google Play under the standard user license. Third-party libraries retain their own licenses. Contact: jonwhitefang@gmail.com. Closes the P0 "no license declaration" finding which would have flagged on any external read of the repo (closed-track recruitment, GitHub-via-Play-Store-listing visibility, etc.).

#### `README.md` rewrite (75 → 127 lines)

| Pri | Fix |
|---|---|
| P0 | New `## Status` section: "Version 1.0.0 (versionCode 6) — pre-launch. Internal-track build verified on a real device 2026-05-18… 615 JVM unit tests green." Links `STATE.md` + `CHANGELOG.md`. Closes the "silent on current phase" finding. |
| P0 | New `## Privacy` section with 3 links: hosted privacy policy URL, hosted data-deletion URL, canonical `docs/release/privacy-policy.md`. Names SQLCipher encryption-at-rest and the Play Billing / AdMob exception explicitly. Closes the privacy-link omission. |
| P0 | New `## License` section pointing at the new `LICENSE` file. |
| P1 | `## Tech Stack` one-liner expanded from 6 items to 11: added SQLCipher (database encryption), Health Connect (paired with the existing Android Sensor API mention), Google Play Billing v8, Google Mobile Ads SDK v25, UMP v4 (consent). Now mentions the canonical `tech.md` version table alongside `AGENTS.md`. |
| P1 | `## Key Documentation` table gained 3 rows: `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `Privacy Policy`. Reordered to put `AGENTS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` near the top since they're the most-referenced live docs. |
| P1 | `## Project Structure` block went one level deeper under `data/` (previously a single `# Room entities, DAOs, repositories impl` line, now broken out into `local/`, `repository/`, `sensor/`, `healthconnect/`, `billing/`, `ads/` with brief descriptions including the C.5 PR 3 / C.6 PR 3 "sole binding" status). `di/` row now lists all 8 modules; `service/` row now mentions the widget. |
| P2 | New `## Where to start` 1-line pointer: read `START_HERE.md` → `STATE.md` → the relevant plan in `docs/plans/`. |
| P2 | The "Note: Instrumented tests…" comment-on-a-comment moved out of the code block into a proper sentence below it. |
| P2 | `## Setup` gained a keystore prerequisite callout: `assembleRelease` / `bundleRelease` need `release/upload-keystore.jks` + `keystore.properties` (both gitignored). Points at `plan-31-walkthrough.md`. The bare `./gradlew assembleRelease` line was dropped from `## Build & Run`; replaced with `./gradlew bundleRelease` (the actual production task) marked with the keystore caveat. |
| P3 | Feature graphic embedded at the top of the README via `![Steps of Babylon](docs/release/store-assets/play-store-feature-graphic-1024x500.png)`. Lifts perceived quality on GitHub. The image already shipped in commit history from 2026-05-13. |

#### Verification

- All 10 cited document links resolve (`StepsOfBabylon_GDD.md`, `architecture.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `master-plan.md`, `battle-formulas.md`, `database-schema.md`, `step-tracking.md`, `monetization.md`, `privacy-policy.md`).
- All build commands match `tech.md` and the on-disk `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
- `run-gradle.sh` recreation snippet now includes the comment line that ships in the actual on-disk file (was a small drift previously).
- No source / test / schema impact. Test count stays at 615.

### Docs sweep — 12 stale live-docs fixed post-RO-12 + versionCode bump (2026-05-19)

Pure-docs PR. Sweep across every live current-state doc (per agent protocol PR Task-List Convention) found 12 drift items left over from the RO-08 / RO-09 / RO-11 / RO-12 / C.5 PR 3 / C.6 PR 3 / Plan 31 PR B sequence and the `1796b4c` versionCode bump. No source / test / schema impact. Historical artifacts (`devdocs/**`, `smoke_tests/**`, `docs/external-reviews/**`, `plan-R*.md`, prior `RUN_LOG` / `CHANGELOG` entries) deliberately left frozen per `.kiro/steering/11-agent-protocol.md`.

| # | File | Drift fixed |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `README.md` | "33-entry development roadmap" → "34-entry" (Plans 01–31 + 10b + R + R2 = 34). |
| 2 | `.kiro/steering/lib-room.md` | "AppDatabase.kt in `data/local/` (12 entities, 12 DAOs)" → "(13 entities, 13 DAOs, schema v9)". |
| 3 | `.kiro/steering/structure.md` | AppDatabase row "(12 entities, 12 DAOs, version 8)" → "(13 entities, 13 DAOs, version 9; `billing_receipt` added in C.5 PR 1)". |
| 4 | `.kiro/steering/tech.md` | Play Billing row updated post-C.5 PR 3: was "flag-gated `@Binds` via `BuildConfig.USE_REAL_BILLING`; debug=stub, release=real", now "sole `BillingManager` binding for debug + release as of C.5 PR 3 (`StubBillingManager` deleted; `BuildConfig.USE_REAL_BILLING` removed)". |
| 5 | `docs/architecture.md` | Hilt module list refreshed: `BillingModule` / `AdModule` no longer reference stubs; sibling `BillingInternalModule` / `AdInternalModule` adapter bindings documented; new `CoroutineScopeModule` (B.3 PR 2 / RO-03) row added; `DatabaseModule` row gained "(13 entities, 13 DAOs, schema v9)". |
| 6 | `docs/monetization.md` | What's-Out-of-Scope lost the stale "live formatted-price display from `ProductDetails.priceDisplay`" bullet (shipped in Plan 31 PR B 2026-05-18); What's-Implemented gained a live-prices line; Out-of-Scope replaced with the two intentional v1.x deferrals from PR B (no refresh on app resume / locale change; no retry on transient network failure). |
| 7 | `docs/plans/master-plan.md` | Status checklist Plan 26 row "(stub implementation — real SDK integration deferred)" → "(real Play Billing v8 + AdMob v25 + UMP v4 wired end-to-end via C.5 PR 1–3 + C.6 PR 1–3; on-device verification PASSED 2026-05-18)". |
| 8 | `docs/plans/plan-31-play-console.md` | Status changed from "Not Started" to a comprehensive "In Progress (Phases A–G landed: …)" line; Dependencies updated to include Plan R (Tier 1) + Plan R2 (Tier 1). Task 4 "Integrate real Google Play Billing Library" + "Integrate real AdMob SDK" struck through with C.5 PR 1–3 / C.6 PR 1–3 done-references. |
| 9 | `docs/battle-formulas.md` | Heaviest edit. Stats Resolution gained the 3rd multiplicative Lab tier (RO-11 #A.1). Damage Calculation gained `DAMAGE_RESEARCH` + `CRITICAL_RESEARCH` outer multipliers. Health & Regen gained `HEALTH_RESEARCH` + `REGEN_RESEARCH` multipliers. Cash Economy gained `cashResearchMultiplier` on both `cashFromKill` and `cashPerWave`. UW Cooldown Scaling gained `uwCooldownMultiplier`. Step Multiplier section rewritten to reflect the live combined `STEP_MULTIPLIER` (Workshop) + `STEP_EFFICIENCY` (Lab) formula under shared +100 % cap, dropping the obsolete "hidden from the Workshop UI (see Remediation R04)" footnote. Two new sections appended: "Lab Research — Wave Skip" (RO-11 #B.1) and "Lab Research — Coming Soon" (RO-11 #B.2). |
| 10 | `docs/step-tracking.md` | Data-flow box now includes the `STEP_MULTIPLIER` (Workshop) + `STEP_EFFICIENCY` (Lab) bonus stage between `StepVelocityAnalyzer` and the 50 k daily ceiling; added an explanatory note clarifying the bonus is sensor-path only and references battle-formulas.md § Step Multiplier. |
| 11 | `AGENTS.md` | Version line bumped "versionCode 5" → "versionCode 6" (commit `1796b4c`); status-checklist Plan 26 row + parallelizable-branches Monetization row both updated to "real Play Billing v8 + AdMob v25 + UMP v4 wired end-to-end". |
| 12 | `docs/agent/STATE.md` | Current objective + Top priorities item #1 + Next actions step #1 all dropped the now-completed "Bump versionCode 5 → 6" sub-step; immediate action is now `bundleRelease` + sign + upload. |

#### Verification

- Re-grep against the original 12 stale strings now matches only frozen historical artifacts (`devdocs/archaeology/**`, `devdocs/foundations/**`, `devdocs/evolution/**`, `smoke_tests/**`, `docs/plans/plan-26-monetization.md`, `docs/external-reviews/**`, prior `RUN_LOG.md` + `CHANGELOG.md` entries) — zero remaining matches in current-state docs.
- `git diff --stat`: 12 files changed, 90 insertions, 42 deletions.
- No source / test / schema impact. Test count stays at 615.

### RO-12 — In-round stat drift bugfix bundle (2026-05-19)

Discovered during v5 internal-track on-device smoke test (Wave 4 screenshot, 06:21 BST 2026-05-19): the `RO-11 #C` "Now → Next" readout rendered correctly on the DEFENSE tab but **the HEALTH "Now" value disagreed with the live ziggurat HP bar by ~5 %** — a drift consistent with `HEALTH_RESEARCH` Lv 1 being included in the readout but stripped from the engine after the player's first in-round purchase.

Root-cause investigation surfaced **3 real stat-resolution bugs plus 1 display-precision bug**, all in the in-round upgrade pipeline:

| # | Bug | RO-11-introduced? |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `BattleViewModel.purchaseInRoundUpgrade` called `resolveStats(workshopLevels, inRoundLevels)` without `labLevels` — stripped lab research bonuses on every in-round purchase. | **Yes** — `labLevels` arg added to `ResolveStats` in RO-11 #A.1; one call site missed during the wiring pass. |
| 2 | Same site did not re-apply `ApplyCardEffects` after recomputing stats — stripped card effects (WALKING_FORTRESS, GLASS_CANNON, IRON_SKIN, SHARP_SHOOTER, VAMPIRIC_TOUCH, CHAIN_REACTION) on every in-round purchase. | **No** — pre-existing since cards landed (Plan 17), but unmasked by RO-11 making the drift visible by stacking lab on top. |
| 3 | `DescribeUpgradeEffect` did not apply card effects either, so the readout drifted from the live engine when any stat-modifying card was equipped. | **Yes** — introduced by RO-11 #C alongside the use case. |
| 4 | `HEALTH_REGEN` readout used `%.1f/s` format. At base ~1.3/s with +2 %/level, per-level delta is ~0.026/s and rounds away — readout showed "Now: 1.3/s → 1.3/s" for a real upgrade, making it look like a no-op. | **Yes** — display-precision oversight in RO-11 #C format string. |

All 4 are closed-test blockers in different ways: Bugs 1 + 2 directly defeat RO-11 acceptance check #1 ("DAMAGE_RESEARCH L5 visibly hits harder") any time a player buys an in-round upgrade; Bug 3 shows the same kind of drift to the player visually; Bug 4 makes a real upgrade look broken. Discovered + fixed in a single morning before promoting v5 → closed.

**Fix (single PR, no schema / DI / public-API changes).**

- **`BattleViewModel.kt`:** new private helper `resolveCurrentStats(inRound: Map<UpgradeType, Int>): ResolvedStats` that runs the full live-engine pipeline `resolveStats(workshop, inRound, lab) → applyCardEffects(stats, equippedCards).stats`. `purchaseInRoundUpgrade` now routes through this helper, so lab + card multipliers survive every in-round purchase. The card-effect *side outputs* (`cashBonusPercent`, `secondWindHpPercent`, `gemMultiplier`) are static for the round and remain computed once in `init` / `playAgain`. `describeEffect` now threads `equippedCards` through to `DescribeUpgradeEffect` so the readout stays in lockstep with the engine.
- **`DescribeUpgradeEffect.kt`:** constructor gains optional `applyCardEffects: ApplyCardEffects = ApplyCardEffects()`; `invoke` gains optional `equippedCards: List<OwnedCard> = emptyList()`. `format` now post-applies `applyCardEffects(raw, equippedCards).stats` before formatting so the readout mirrors the engine pipeline. Default `emptyList()` preserves pre-RO-12 behaviour for the 25 existing test call sites and any future Workshop-screen call site that doesn't have card context.
- **`HEALTH_REGEN` format:** `%.1f/s` → `%.2f/s`. One character. Other format strings unchanged because they have larger per-level magnitudes (e.g., `KNOCKBACK` per-level delta is +0.1 px which is visible at 1 decimal).

**Test coverage: 609 → 615 (+6 net).**

- `BattleViewModelTest` +3 with new `installEngineForPurchase` reflective helper:
  - `RO12 in-round HEALTH purchase preserves HEALTH_RESEARCH lab bonus` — Bug 1 direct guard. Post-purchase `maxHealth = BASE × 1.20 (lab L4) × 1.03 (in-round L1)` instead of pre-fix `BASE × 1.03`.
  - `RO12 in-round HEALTH purchase preserves WALKING_FORTRESS card bonus` — Bug 2 direct guard. Post-purchase `maxHealth = BASE × 1.50 (WF L1) × 1.03` instead of pre-fix `BASE × 1.03`.
  - `RO12 in-round HEALTH purchase preserves both lab AND card bonuses stacked` — combined regression matching the screenshot scenario (`BASE × 1.20 × 1.03 × 1.50 = 1854 HP` post-fix vs `1030 HP` pre-fix — 824 HP drift in a single screen).
- `DescribeUpgradeEffectTest` +3:
  - Existing `HEALTH_REGEN` test renamed to `"2-decimal format"` with expected value `"1.20/s"`.
  - `RO12 HEALTH_REGEN Lv 0 to Lv 1 produces a visibly different readout` — Bug 4 direct guard. Asserts `"1.00/s" → "1.02/s"` with `assertNotEquals` for clarity.
  - `RO12 HEALTH readout reflects equipped WALKING_FORTRESS card multiplier` — Bug 3 direct guard. ws=5 HEALTH + WALKING_FORTRESS Lv 1 → `"1725 HP"` (pre-fix would have been `"1150 HP"`).
  - `RO12 HEALTH readout with no cards equipped is unchanged from pre-RO12 baseline` — default-arg behaviour preserved for the 25 existing tests.

**Verification.**

- `./run-gradle.sh testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, **615 tests pass (609 → 615, +6)**, zero failures.
- versionCode bump (5 → 6) deferred to the upload PR so this PR is reviewable in isolation.

**On-device verification (post-merge).** Once v6 hits the internal track, repeat the v5 smoke test plus 5 RO-12-specific checks per `docs/plans/plan-RO-12-in-round-stat-drift.md` § 8: HP bar matches HEALTH "Now" with HEALTH_RESEARCH owned, HP bar still matches after any in-round purchase, HP bar matches with WALKING_FORTRESS equipped, HEALTH_REGEN row shows 2-decimal readout that visibly changes Lv 0 → Lv 1, and RO-11 acceptance check #1 still passes after multiple in-round purchases.

### RO-11 — Labs research wiring + in-round upgrade-effect readout (2026-05-19)

Pre-RO-11 all 10 `ResearchType` enums were dead — declared with effect descriptions, costing Steps + real-time + Gems (rush) to complete, displayed correctly on the Labs screen, but never consumed by any combat-path / step-credit / cash-economy / UW-cooldown class. Same shape as RO-08 #1 (`STEP_MULTIPLIER` + `RECOVERY_PACKAGES`) and RO-09 #1 (`CHRONO_FIELD`), wider blast radius (entire Labs system instead of single enum). Closes the dead-enum gap that would have surfaced as "research does nothing" closed-test feedback within the first round of any tester at level 3+ `DAMAGE_RESEARCH`. Discovery context: user reported on top of the Labs gap that the in-round upgrade menu didn't show numerical effect of each purchase (originally tracked as RO-10, absorbed as Phase C of RO-11).

**Phase A — 7 simple multipliers wired (commits `d3dc4d6` / `a4eca72` / `14b0665`, +9 tests).**

- `DAMAGE_RESEARCH` / `HEALTH_RESEARCH` / `CRITICAL_RESEARCH` / `REGEN_RESEARCH` attach as a third multiplicative tier inside `ResolveStats.invoke` (signature gains optional `labLevels: Map<ResearchType, Int> = emptyMap()`). Formula: `base × (1 + ws × per) × (1 + ir × per) × (1 + lab × labPer)`.
- `CASH_RESEARCH` (per-kill cash + wave-end cash) and `UW_COOLDOWN` (cooldown set in `activateUW`) wire onto `GameEngine` via two new `@Volatile` fields (`cashResearchMultiplier: Double = 1.0`, `uwCooldownMultiplier: Float = 1f`). `BattleViewModel` reads `LabRepository.observeAllResearch()` once per round in `init` / `playAgain` and pushes the multipliers via private helpers; `UWSlotInfo.cooldownTotal` mirrors `eng.uwCooldownMultiplier` so the cooldown ring-fill UI tracks the actual cooldown.
- `STEP_EFFICIENCY` (per-walking-credit) wires onto `DailyStepManager` (constructor gains `LabRepository` as 16th param). `applyStepMultiplier` now reads BOTH the workshop `STEP_MULTIPLIER` level AND the lab `STEP_EFFICIENCY` level on every credit; combines additively under the existing `STEP_MULTIPLIER_CAP = 1.0` (per plan-RO-11 § 9 open question #3 — shared cap, not separate). New `STEP_EFFICIENCY_PER_LEVEL = 0.02` constant. Activity minutes intentionally still excluded for the same GDD wording rationale that excluded them from `STEP_MULTIPLIER` in RO-08.

**Phase B — `WAVE_SKIP` wired + AUTO_UPGRADE_AI / ENEMY_INTEL gated (commits `28337e5` / `6b754c9`, +3 tests).**

- `WaveSpawner` gains `private val startWave: Int = 1` constructor param; `var currentWave: Int = startWave` replaces the hardcoded `= 1`. `GameEngine.init()` accepts optional `startWave: Int = 1`, coerces to ≥1, threads into both the WaveSpawner constructor AND `triggerWaveAnnouncement(...)` so the HUD slide-in shows the correct opening wave. `GameSurfaceView.configure(...)` extends with `startWave: Int = 1` and threads through all 3 internal `engine.init` call sites (`configure` / `surfaceCreated` / `surfaceChanged`). `BattleViewModel` exposes `var startWave: Int = 1; private set` (mirrors `var labLevels` shape from Phase A) computed via `(1 + WAVE_SKIP_level).coerceAtLeast(1)` — L0 = wave 1 (current behaviour), L10 = wave 11. `BattleScreen` reads `viewModel.startWave` and pushes through `surfaceView.configure(...)` when isLoading flips to false.
- `ResearchType` gains optional `isComingSoon: Boolean = false` constructor parameter; `AUTO_UPGRADE_AI` and `ENEMY_INTEL` set `isComingSoon = true` and have descriptions updated to *"Reserved for v1.x — research progress preserved"*. `LabsScreen` renders a "COMING SOON" badge in the row header (tertiary color, takes priority over MAX / level chip) and suppresses the entire Start / Rush / Progress UI block for those rows. `LabsViewModel.startResearch` adds a defensive belt-and-braces guard: early-return + snackbar message if a Coming Soon type ever reaches the VM via a future entry point. Research progress preserved on the deferred two so the v1.x real implementations pick up where players left off.

**Phase C — `DescribeUpgradeEffect` use case + in-round readout (commit `93f6ae8`, +25 tests).**

User report (originally RO-10): *"It is hard to see the upgrades and how they affect the tower. Can we have this visible, such as damage in round shown by the upgrade, and the same with all of them?"* — Pre-fix the in-round upgrade menu showed only the description text and cost button. Now every visible row shows a third Text below the description in Gold (#D4A843):

```
DAMAGE                                                   [$50]
Lv 3 · +2% base damage per level
Now: 12.5 dmg → Next: 13.0 dmg                          ← new
```

- New use case `domain/usecase/DescribeUpgradeEffect.kt`. `UpgradeEffectReadout(current: String, next: String?)` — `next` is `null` when at maxLevel (UI renders "Now: X (MAX)" instead of arrow). Operator-fun signature mirrors `ResolveStats` and shares its instance for drift-free preview. Stat-bearing upgrades call `resolveStats` twice; cash utilities + hidden upgrades compute from `UpgradeConfig.effectPerLevel` directly with cap clamps. Format strings pinned to `Locale.ROOT` so de-DE / fr-FR users don't see "12,5 dmg" diverging from the rest of the English-only v1.0 strings (plan § 9 open question #5 — localization is v2.0 effort).
- Lab-research outer multipliers (Phase A) flow through the same `format` path so a tester with `DAMAGE_RESEARCH L5` sees the bonus reflected in the readout — closing the visibility loop the user originally asked for.
- `BattleViewModel.describeEffect(type)` is the public seam; `InRoundUpgradeMenu` accepts an optional `describeEffect: (UpgradeType) -> UpgradeEffectReadout` parameter with no-op fallback. `BattleScreen` passes `viewModel::describeEffect` through.

**Test coverage: 572 → 609 (+37 new tests, vs ~36 plan target).**

- `ResolveStatsTest` +4 (per stat-bearing research type outer multiplier).
- `GameEngineTest` +2 (`cashResearchMultiplier` 2.0× kill cash + `uwCooldownMultiplier` 0.55× CHAIN_LIGHTNING cooldown).
- `DailyStepManagerTest` +3 (STEP_EFFICIENCY alone, STEP_MULTIPLIER + STEP_EFFICIENCY combined, shared +100 % cap).
- `WaveSpawnerTest` +1 new file (currentWave reads from startWave constructor; L11 path).
- `BattleViewModelTest` +1 (WAVE_SKIP L5 → startWave = 6 propagation).
- `ResearchTypeTest` +1 new file (set-equality contract: only AUTO_UPGRADE_AI + ENEMY_INTEL are `isComingSoon`).
- `DescribeUpgradeEffectTest` +25 new file (per-upgrade-type Now → Next readout coverage including caps + lab-research stacking + smoke test).

**Open questions resolved against plan-RO-11 § 9.**

| # | Question | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `WAVE_SKIP` semantics | "start at wave 1 + level" — L0 = wave 1 (current), L10 = wave 11 |
| 2 | Lab × workshop stacking | Multiplicative — matches RO-08 ws × ir × lab pattern |
| 3 | `STEP_EFFICIENCY` + `STEP_MULTIPLIER` cap | Shared +100 % cap, not separate |
| 4 | Steps already spent on deferred enums | No refund; research progress preserved for v1.x |
| 5 | Readout localization | English-only via `Locale.ROOT`; localization is v2.0 effort |

**Verification.**

- `./run-gradle.sh test --rerun-tasks` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 609 tests pass (was 572, +37). Zero failures across all suites.

- **Internal track release (2026-05-19 morning):** versionCode bumped 4 → 5 (commit `734beaa`); signed AAB ~18 MB uploaded to Play Console internal track; v5 release notes for Play Console + closed-track tester recruitment landed in `docs/release/` (commit `d9f48e3`). Awaiting on-device smoke test of the 8 RO-11 acceptance checks before closed-track promotion.

**Out of scope / deferred to v1.x backlog.**

- `ENEMY_INTEL` real implementation (HP-bar gating + wave preview UI + boss telegraph banner).
- Cross-validator unit fix for combined `STEP_MULTIPLIER` + `STEP_EFFICIENCY` against `hcSteps` (same as RO-09 deferred #3 — schema migration v9 → v10).
- Workshop-screen surface of the same readout (the use case already supports it via the hidden-but-tested-for-reuse paths).
- `BattleViewModel` constructor refactor — now at 16 params; ADR + extraction candidate for v1.x.

### RO-09 — Pre-closed-test fixes (2026-05-18)

A self-audit run after RO-08 surfaced 7 latent issues; this PR lands the 3 that were flagged for **fix-before-closed-test**. The other 4 are bounded-impact lifetime-stat / atomicity / unit-mismatch issues with effectively zero exposure during the 14-day closed-test window — they're documented in `docs/plans/plan-RO-09-pre-closed-test-fixes.md` § "Deferred findings (v1.x)" for follow-up. Audit motivation: maximise the quality of the v1.0 closed-test build before the 14-day clock starts.

**Fix #1 — CHRONO_FIELD UW now actually slows enemies (commit `fcb282e`).**

Pre-fix: the description claimed *"Slows all enemies to 10 % speed for duration"* (8 s, 75 Power-Stone unlock cost). The activate path set `chronoActive = true` and the expire path reset it, but the **only** consumer of `chronoActive` anywhere in the codebase was the rendering overlay (purple full-screen tint). `EnemyEntity.update` read raw `speed`; `GameEngine.update` passed raw `deltaTime` to every entity. Net: a player who unlocked CHRONO_FIELD spent 75 Power Stones and saw an 8-second purple-tinted screen with zero gameplay effect. Same shape as the RO-08 dead-enum findings — feature wired into UI / cooldown / cost path but disconnected from gameplay.

- New companion constant `CHRONO_SLOW_FACTOR = 0.10f`.
- `GameEngine.update` entity loop now scales `deltaTime` per-entity: `if (chronoActive && e is EnemyEntity) deltaTime * CHRONO_SLOW_FACTOR else deltaTime`. The gate on `EnemyEntity` keeps projectiles, orbs, and the ziggurat at full speed, so player-side timing (shoot cooldowns, projectile travel, orb orbit) is unaffected.

**Fix #2 — GOLDEN_ZIGGURAT × overdrive `fortuneMultiplier` stacking (commit `f4d5997`).**

`fortuneMultiplier` is a single shared field used by **both** Step Overdrive FORTUNE (3.0×) and Ultimate Weapon GOLDEN_ZIGGURAT (5.0×). The lifecycle paths leaked the buff in three ways:

| Pre-fix scenario | Pre-fix value | Correct value |
|---|---|---|
| GOLDEN expires, FORTUNE active | 5.0× (preserved) | **3.0×** (FORTUNE owns it) |
| GOLDEN expires, ASSAULT active | 5.0× (leaked) | **1.0×** |
| GOLDEN expires, FORTRESS active | 5.0× (leaked) | **1.0×** |
| GOLDEN expires, SURGE active | 5.0× (leaked) | **1.0×** |
| FORTUNE activates while GOLDEN active | 3.0× (downgrade) | **5.0×** (GOLDEN's higher value wins) |
| ASSAULT/FORTRESS/SURGE expires, GOLDEN still active | 1.0× (collapsed) | **5.0×** (GOLDEN still owns it) |

The most exploitable case: activate ASSAULT (1.0× cash), then GOLDEN_ZIGGURAT (5.0× cash). When GOLDEN expired while ASSAULT was still active, the 5.0× multiplier persisted for the remainder of ASSAULT's window — up to ~50 s of unintended 5× cash uptime per round.

Three production edits in `GameEngine.kt`, each preserving the invariant *"the higher of the two buffs always wins; the lower restores cleanly when one ends"*:

- `activateOverdrive(FORTUNE)`: `fortuneMultiplier = fortuneMultiplier.coerceAtLeast(3.0)` — symmetrical to the existing GOLDEN activate which uses `coerceAtLeast(5.0)`.
- `expireOverdrive`: `fortuneMultiplier = if (goldenZigActive) 5.0 else 1.0`.
- GOLDEN expire branch in `updateUWs`: `fortuneMultiplier = if (activeOverdrive == OverdriveType.FORTUNE) 3.0 else 1.0`.

**Fix #7 — Dead `total` expression in `LabsScreen.kt:106` (commit `fdc34d3`).**

`val total = info.remainingMs + (System.currentTimeMillis() - (System.currentTimeMillis() - info.remainingMs))` — algebraically `2 × info.remainingMs`, never read. Refactor leftover; the next line recomputes `totalMs` correctly via `info.timeToCompleteHours * 3_600_000`. One-line delete, zero behaviour change.

**Test coverage: 565 → 572 (+7 new tests).**

- `GameEngineTest` +3 RO-09 #1: chrono active slows enemies to 10 % of baseline (ratio in 0.08..0.12 tolerance band); chrono inactive is deterministic across fresh engines; chrono active does **not** slow `ProjectileEntity` (regression guard for the `EnemyEntity`-only gate).
- `GameEngineTest` +4 RO-09 #2: GOLDEN expiry preserves FORTUNE's 3.0× when FORTUNE active; GOLDEN expiry resets to 1.0 when ASSAULT active (regression guard for the leak); FORTUNE activation does not downgrade GOLDEN's 5.0×; `expireOverdrive` preserves GOLDEN's 5.0× when GOLDEN still active.

New test helpers: `setChronoActive(eng, Boolean)` (reflection on private `chronoActive` field), `simulateEnemyMovement(activateChrono)` (fresh-engine baseline-vs-chrono comparator), `readFortuneMultiplier(eng)` (reflection on private `fortuneMultiplier`), `activateGoldenZigForTest(eng, level)` (uses public `initUWs` + `activateUW` path), `invokeUpdateUWs(eng, deltaTime)` (reflection on private `updateUWs(Float)` to deterministically expire UWs without ticking the overdrive timer / wave spawner / collisions).

**Out of scope / deferred to v1.x:**

- **Finding #3 — STEP_MULTIPLIER × cross-validator unit mismatch.** Post-RO-08, `record.creditedSteps` includes the multiplier bonus but the cross-validator compares it raw against `hcSteps`. Edge case affecting players with prior CV offenses **and** STEP_MULTIPLIER ≥ 1. Fix requires a `multiplierBonusApplied` column on `daily_step_record` + migration v9 → v10. Closed-test cohort almost certainly has clean step history and zero exposure during the 14-day window.
- **Finding #4 — Currency lifetime counter desync.** `addGems` / `spendGems` / `addPowerStones` / `spendPowerStones` fire two `@Query` UPDATEs back-to-back, not in `@Transaction`. Lifetime counters can drift on crash. Display-only impact (Stats screen).
- **Finding #5 — TOCTOU race on gem / PS spend.** `MAX(0, balance + delta)` clamps the wallet but `incrementSpent` records the full requested amount. Wallet stays correct; lifetime drifts.
- **Finding #6 — Per-kill battle-step credit on `viewModelScope`.** End-of-round persistence migrated to `applicationScope` in RO-03 B.3 PR 2, but per-kill credits still launch on `viewModelScope`. Mid-round nav-away cancels in-flight credits; loss bounded to ≤ 1 step per pending callback.

**Verification:**

- `./run-gradle.sh test` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 572 tests pass (was 565, +7).
- `./run-gradle.sh bundleRelease` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, clean R8 minify + lint vital + signing.
- After this PR lands: bump `versionCode 3 → 4` and re-upload to the internal track for one final smoke check, then promote internal v4 → closed track.

### RO-08 — Bundle of 4 upgrade-wiring fixes (2026-05-18)

External code review highlighted that several Workshop / Card upgrades were declared but not actually applied to the tower during play. This PR closes all four gaps in a single change. No SKU / billing / ad-SDK touchpoints — purely engine, ResolveStats, and DailyStepManager.

**Fix #1 — STEP_MULTIPLIER + RECOVERY_PACKAGES wired in (previously dead enums).**

- `STEP_MULTIPLIER`: `DailyStepManager` gained a `WorkshopRepository` constructor parameter and an `applyStepMultiplier(baseCredit)` helper. The bonus applies on the sensor (walking) credit path only — not on activity minutes (cycling / swimming / treadmill from Health Connect) — matching the GDD §4.3 wording "+1 % bonus steps earned from walking" and avoiding a churn to the existing `dailyActivityMinuteTotal += credited` source-tracking semantics. The bonus applies *after* anti-cheat (rate limit + velocity analysis) and *before* the 50 k absolute daily ceiling, so the cap stays an absolute ceiling. Cap on the multiplier itself is +100 % per GDD. Fresh DB read on each credit so level-ups take effect immediately.
- `RECOVERY_PACKAGES`: `GameEngine` now ticks a private `tickRecoveryPackages(deltaTime)` helper inside the main `update()` loop. Pulses fire only during `WavePhase.SPAWNING` (not during between-wave cooldowns — the upgrade's framing is "during waves"); the timer resets between waves so the first pulse of a new wave waits a full 30 s. Constants `RECOVERY_INTERVAL_SECONDS=30f`, `RECOVERY_PERCENT_PER_LEVEL=0.01`, `RECOVERY_PERCENT_PER_PULSE_CAP=0.50`. At full HP the pulse is suppressed but the timer still resets so a freshly-damaged tower waits one full interval. Heal floors at 1 HP for visible feedback. Spawns a green floating-text indicator above the tower; no sound (automatic effect, audio could be noisy).

**Fix #2 — `ZigguratEntity` stale-stats propagation.**

The entity captured `attackInterval` (`val`) and `attackRange` (`val`) at construction and held a `val stats: ResolvedStats` reference. After construction, any `engine.stats = stats.copy(...)` (Overdrive ASSAULT/FORTRESS, in-round upgrades, GOLDEN_ZIGGURAT UW) created a new `ResolvedStats` instance the engine saw but the entity didn't. Concrete bug: ASSAULT's "2× attack speed" and FORTRESS's "2× health regen" silently no-op'd; in-round ATTACK_SPEED purchases never made the tower fire faster.

- `ZigguratEntity.stats` is now a `var` with a `private set` and a `fun updateStats(newStats)` setter.
- `attackInterval` is a private computed property `get() = (1.0 / stats.attackSpeed).toFloat()` recomputed each tick from the live `stats`.
- `attackRange` becomes `val attackRange: Float get() = stats.range` — same idea.
- `GameEngine.applyStats(newStats)` is the single mutation point: replaces `engine.stats`, calls `zig.updateStats(newStats)`, rebalances `currentHp` proportionally if `maxHealth` changed, and re-spawns orbs if `orbCount` changed. All five stat-mutation sites (`setStats`, `activateOverdrive` ASSAULT/FORTRESS arms, `expireOverdrive`, GOLDEN_ZIGGURAT UW activate + expire, `updateZigguratStats`) route through `applyStats`.

**Fix #3 — In-round upgrade coverage matches GDD §5.**

Battle-formulas.md §Stats Resolution and GDD §5 both state "All Workshop stats have corresponding in-round upgrades that stack multiplicatively." Pre-RO-08 only DAMAGE / ATTACK_SPEED / HEALTH had an `ir(...)` term in `ResolveStats`; the other 14 stat-bearing upgrades silently produced no in-round effect even though the in-round upgrade menu deducted cash for them.

- `ResolveStats` now applies `ir(...)` to all 14 stat-bearing types. Multiplicative stats (`damage`, `attackSpeed`, `maxHealth`, `healthRegen`, `range`, `knockbackForce`) follow the documented `(1 + ws*x) × (1 + ir*x)` formula. Additive stats (`critChance`, `critMultiplier`, `defensePercent`, `defenseAbsolute`, `thornPercent`, `lifestealPercent`, `damagePerMeterBonus`, `deathDefyChance`, `multishotTargets`, `bounceCount`, `orbCount`) sum the two level sources before applying the per-level effect and any cap. Range now uses the multiplicative form coerced to `≤ BASE × 3` (matches the prior cap; previously the cap clamped only the workshop term).
- `InRoundUpgradeMenu` mirrors the WorkshopViewModel hidden-set: `STEP_MULTIPLIER` and `RECOVERY_PACKAGES` are filtered out of the in-round menu (passive walking-bonus and periodic-heal effects don't fit the cash-fed in-round mechanic).
- `GameEngine` renamed `workshopLevels` → `effectiveLevels` (private) and added `fun updateEffectiveLevels(combined)`. `BattleViewModel.purchaseInRoundUpgrade` builds a `combinedLevelsForCash()` map (additive merge of `workshopLevels + inRoundLevels`) and pushes it to the engine on every purchase. The `FREE_UPGRADES` free-roll chance is now read from the same combined map, so a mid-round FREE_UPGRADES level contributes to its own subsequent free-roll chances. Result: in-round purchases of `CASH_BONUS` / `CASH_PER_WAVE` / `INTEREST` / `FREE_UPGRADES` now actually take effect for subsequent kill rewards / wave-end bonuses / interest payouts / free-upgrade rolls.

**Fix #4 — STEP_SURGE card multiplies the watch-ad gem reward.**

`ApplyCardEffects` already computed `gemMultiplier` from STEP_SURGE; `BattleViewModel` was discarding the field. Now stored as `cardGemMultiplier`, refreshed in `init` and `playAgain`, applied in `watchGemAd` via `(1.0 * cardGemMultiplier).toLong().coerceAtLeast(1L)`. Default `1.0` keeps the existing 1-gem reward unchanged when no STEP_SURGE is equipped; Lv1 → 2 gems, Lv5 → 4 gems. The post-round reward-ad path is currently the only in-game gem source in the round, so this lights up the card's full design.

**Test coverage: 535 → 565 (+30 new tests).**

- `ResolveStatsTest` +20: in-round multiplier coverage for every stat-bearing type (multiplicative attackSpeed / healthRegen / range / knockback; additive crit chance/factor, defense %/abs, thorn, lifesteal, damage/meter, death-defy, multishot, bounce, orbs); each cap (range × 3, crit 80 %, defense 75 %, lifesteal 15 %, death-defy 50 %, multishot 5 targets, orbs 6) verified under combined ws+ir.
- `BattleViewModelTest` +2: STEP_SURGE Lv1 doubles ad reward (1 → 2 gems); Lv5 quadruples (1 → 4).
- `GameEngineTest` (new file) +5: ASSAULT propagates 2× attackSpeed to ziggurat; FORTRESS propagates 2× healthRegen; expireOverdrive restores baseline interval; `updateEffectiveLevels` updates the engine's level map; RECOVERY_PACKAGES heal pulse fires at 30 s in SPAWNING phase; level 0 produces no heal; full HP suppresses pulse; pulse caps at 50 % maxHp.
- `DailyStepManagerTest` +5: STEP_MULTIPLIER level 0 is a no-op; level 50 grants +50 % bonus; cap at +100 % regardless of level; 50 k daily ceiling clamps multiplied credit; multiplier does NOT apply to activity minutes.

GameEngineTest uses reflection to invoke the private `tickRecoveryPackages(Float)` and `expireOverdrive()` helpers — bypasses the full game-loop side effects (enemy spawning, melee hits, projectile collisions) so the heal-only and stats-only assertions stay deterministic.

**Out of scope / future work:**

- The `STEP_MULTIPLIER` lookup runs a Room flow `.first()` on every credit — fine for the typical sensor cadence (1 credit per ~30 sensor ticks max via the rate limiter) but could be cached if profiling reveals contention.
- Activity-minute deltas don't get the multiplier (intentional — see the "Fix #1" notes above on the `dailyActivityMinuteTotal += credited` source-tracking semantics). A future v1.x could extend the multiplier to activity minutes by changing that to `+= delta` and tracking HC raw progress separately.
- RECOVERY_PACKAGES uses no sound effect to avoid noise during automatic firing. A subtle blip could be added in v1.x.

### PR C — Plan 31 walkthrough doc revision: 4 lessons-learned + minor footguns (2026-05-18)

Pure-docs PR. The walkthrough at `docs/release/plan-31-walkthrough.md` was written before the first end-to-end Plan 31 run; the live walk-through with the user surfaced four things the doc didn't anticipate, plus three smaller footguns. All fixed inline + summarised in a new "Updated 2026-05-18" preamble at the top.

Lessons fixed:

1. **Android Developer Verification (mandatory since late 2025).** New "E1 detour" subsection walks through the debug-keystore registration path: confirm the offered SHA-256 matches `~/.android/debug.keystore`, drop a one-line `assets/adi-registration.properties` snippet, build a debug APK, verify, upload, delete the snippet. Cites ADR-0007.
2. **Lowercase SKU IDs.** Phase F's product-ID table now uses `gem_pack_small` / `ad_removal` / `season_pass` etc. (matches `BillingProduct.skuId()`). Phase F also documents the `Purchase option ID` field's `[a-z0-9-]` format requirement (hyphens, not underscores) with recommended values mirroring the product IDs.
3. **Closed testing is mandatory — ≥12 testers, ≥14 days.** Phase I1 retitled from "(optional)" to "(mandatory)" with explicit recruitment + opt-in URL guidance + the 14-day calendar clock that gates the Production-access form.
4. **The native debug symbols warning is unfixable for v1.** New callout in Phase G2 explains SQLCipher + androidx.graphics.path ship pre-stripped; `ndk { debugSymbolLevel = "FULL" }` is correct config but bundles zero symbols. The warning is informational, not a blocker.

Minor footguns also documented:

- `versionCode` is forward-only — a `bundleRelease` smoke test consumes the counter permanently in Play Console even without rollout.
- Phase E6 (pricing & distribution) is a no-op in modern Play Console; country/region selection moved into the Phase G release flow.
- Phase F now mentions Plan 31 PR B's live-price wiring, so a future doc reader knows in-app prices auto-track Play Console.
- Contact email updated from the `support@whitefanggames.com` placeholder to the actual `jonwhitefang@gmail.com`.
- `versionCode` table cell now points at `app/build.gradle.kts` as the live source instead of saying "`1`".

No source / test impact.

### PR B — Live formatted price from Play Billing's `ProductDetails.priceDisplay` (2026-05-18)

Pre-closed-testing UX/footgun fix. The Store screen previously read
`BillingProduct.priceDisplay` static constants directly (`"$0.99"`, `"$3.99"`, etc.).
If a Play Console price ever drifted from the constant — e.g. as briefly happened
earlier this Plan 31 cycle when `ad_removal` was almost set to $9.99 with the in-app
label still saying $3.99 — testers would see one price in-app and be charged a
different price by the Play Billing dialog. Bait-and-switch territory and a Play Store
policy concern even on test cards.

Now Play Console is the source of truth for the user-visible price, with the static
constants kept as a build-time fallback for offline / pre-query.

- **`BillingManager.getPriceDisplay(product): String?`** — new interface method with a
  default no-op (`null`) so test fakes inherit a do-nothing contract. KDoc cites locale
  examples (`"£0.79"`, `"€0,99"`) and explicitly tells callers to handle the `null`
  case by falling back to `BillingProduct.priceDisplay`.
- **`BillingManagerImpl` override** — `sessionMutex.withLock { ensureConnected() →
  queryProductDetails(listOf(skuId), productType) → firstOrNull()?.priceDisplay }`.
  Failure paths (`connect` error, `QueryProductDetailsResult.Error`, empty result list)
  all return `null` with a `Log.w` for diagnosability. Mutex shared with `purchase()` and
  `reconcilePendingPurchases()` so the live-price refresh on Store entry can't race a
  purchase-in-progress.
- **`StoreViewModel.refreshPriceDisplays()`** — launched once on init alongside the
  existing `reconcilePendingPurchases` hook. Iterates `BillingProduct.entries`,
  populating `_priceDisplays: MutableStateFlow<Map<BillingProduct, String>>` progressively
  as each query completes. Failures (null) are skipped — the missing key signals the UI
  to fall back. Marked `@VisibleForTesting internal` so unit tests can drive a
  deterministic refresh.
- **`StoreUiState.priceDisplays: Map<BillingProduct, String>`** — new field combining
  the 5th flow argument into the existing `combine` chain. Default empty map; missing
  keys are the explicit fallback signal at the UI layer.
- **`StoreScreen`** — every price label changed from
  `BillingProduct.X.priceDisplay` to `state.priceDisplays[X] ?: BillingProduct.X.priceDisplay`.
  3 sites: Gem packs, Ad Removal, Season Pass. Inline comment cites Plan 31 PR B.
- **`FakeBillingManager.priceDisplayOverrides: MutableMap<BillingProduct, String?>`** —
  test knob. Empty map (default) → `getPriceDisplay` returns `null` for every product,
  matching the production behaviour when Play Billing is unavailable. Tests opt in by
  populating the map.

#### Tests (+5, 530 → 535)

- **`BillingManagerImplTest`** (+3): `getPriceDisplay returns adapter priceDisplay on success`
  (asserts `"£0.79"` surfaces verbatim, locale-formatted by Play Billing); `... returns
  null when product details query fails` (`QueryProductDetailsResult.Error` → null);
  `... returns null when adapter cannot connect` (`SdkBillingResult.BillingUnavailable`
  → null).
- **`StoreViewModelTest`** (+2): `priceDisplays starts empty so the UI falls back to
  static priceDisplay` (no overrides set → `state.priceDisplays.isEmpty()`);
  `priceDisplays populates from getPriceDisplay results on init` (3 of 5 products
  override-mapped to non-null values, 2 deliberately omitted to assert that missing
  keys remain absent rather than landing as empty strings).

#### Out-of-scope (intentional v1.x deferrals)

- **No price refresh on app resume / locale change.** Prices are queried once on Store
  entry. If the device locale changes mid-session, the user has to re-enter the Store
  to see localized prices. Acceptable for v1.
- **No retry on transient network failure.** A single null sticks for the whole Store
  session. Acceptable because the static fallback is a known-good price baked into the
  AAB at build time — the user always sees something sensible. Revisit if support
  surfaces "my prices look weird" tickets post-launch.

No DB schema change. No new dependencies.

### PR A — Surface ad-error feedback as snackbar in Battle + Cards screens (2026-05-18)

Pre-closed-testing UX polish. Three call sites (`CardsViewModel.watchFreePackAd`, `BattleViewModel.watchGemAd`, `BattleViewModel.watchPsAd`) previously swallowed `AdResult.Cancelled` and `AdResult.Error` silently, so a tester tapping "Watch ad for Gems" on a device that returned `NO_FILL` got no feedback at all. Now they get a clear snackbar message — mirrors the `userMessage: StateFlow<String?>` pattern already used by `MissionsViewModel` / `WorkshopViewModel` / `LabsViewModel` / `CardsViewModel.upgradeCard`.

- **`CardsViewModel.watchFreePackAd`** — `if (result is AdResult.Rewarded)` opened up to a `when` over all three variants. `Cancelled` → "Ad cancelled. Try again."; `Error` → the adapter's `result.message` verbatim (or a generic fallback when blank, since `RewardAdManagerImpl` can return blank for some Mobile Ads SDK error codes).
- **`BattleViewModel.watchGemAd` + `watchPsAd`** — same pattern. Added `userMessage: String?` field to `BattleUiState`, `clearMessage()` method to the VM. The `watchPsAd` Rewarded branch correctly keeps its `state.powerStonesAwarded > 0` guard inside the `Rewarded` arm so the user does not get the "reward credited" feedback for a 0-stones round.
- **`BattleScreen`** wraps a `SnackbarHost` aligned to bottom-center, drawn last in the outer `Box` so it stacks on top of every other overlay (including `PostRoundOverlay`, where the watchGemAd / watchPsAd buttons live). `LaunchedEffect(state.userMessage)` calls `showSnackbar` then `viewModel.clearMessage()` so each event surfaces exactly once.
- **6 new tests, +6 total — 524 → 530.**
  - `CardsViewModelTest`: extended 2 existing `Cancelled` / `Error` cases to assert `userMessage` is set; added 1 new test for the blank-message fallback (`AdResult.Error("")` → "Ad failed to load. Try again later.").
  - `BattleViewModelTest`: 5 new tests — `watchGemAd Cancelled` + `watchGemAd Error`, `watchPsAd Cancelled` (uses `installEngineForEndRound + quitRound` to set up a `roundEndState`) + `watchPsAd Error` (blank-message fallback), and `clearMessage nulls userMessage`.

No behaviour change on the happy `Rewarded` paths. No new dependencies. No DB schema change.

### C.5 PR 3 — Delete `StubBillingManager`, collapse `BillingModule` to `@Binds BillingManagerImpl` (2026-05-18)

Mechanical follow-up to the Phase G internal-track on-device smoke-test PASS earlier the same day. With real Play Billing v8 verified end-to-end on a real device, the second `BillingManager` implementation has no remaining purpose.

- **`StubBillingManager` deleted** (`data/billing/StubBillingManager.kt`, 36 lines). The class simulated purchases with a 500 ms delay and credited gems / set flags directly on `PlayerRepository` — useful while real Play Billing was unwired, redundant now.
- **`BillingModule` collapsed** from a flag-gated `@Provides` Provider-switch to two plain `@Binds` abstract classes. `BillingModule` now binds `BillingManager → BillingManagerImpl`; sibling `BillingInternalModule` keeps the existing `BillingClientAdapter → RealBillingClientAdapter` binding. KDoc rewritten to capture the C.5 PR 1–3 history. Mirrors the C.6 PR 3 collapse of `AdModule`.
- **`BuildConfig.USE_REAL_BILLING` removed.** No code reads it anymore. Removed from `app/build.gradle.kts` defaultConfig + debug + release blocks; the `buildFeatures.buildConfig` opt-in comment now references `USE_REAL_ADS` (the surviving flag) only. `AdModule.kt` KDoc lost its "symmetric with USE_REAL_BILLING" line. The `app/build.gradle.kts` Play Billing dependency comment was also refreshed to note `BillingManagerImpl` is the sole binding.
- **KDoc cleanup across 5 production files.** `BillingManagerImpl.kt` lost its "PR 1 wiring status" block; `BillingManager.kt` interface lost its `@link` to `StubBillingManager`; `ActivityProvider.kt` lost its "binding still points at Stub" line; `StoreViewModel.kt` lost its mention of Stub + `USE_REAL_BILLING`; `AdModule.kt` lost the "symmetric flag" reference. All replaced with present-tense descriptions.
- **`BillingManagerParityTest` deleted** (3 tests). It existed to assert that Stub and Real produce equivalent wallet/flag effects on the golden path during the C.5 PR 2 transition. With Stub gone, the only remaining side is Real, and that's already exhaustively covered by `BillingManagerImplTest` (14 tests — 3 happy paths + 5 failure paths + idempotency + 2 reconciliation cases + delegation).
- **`docs/monetization.md` Implementation Status block fully refreshed.** The doc had been stale since pre-C.5/C.6: still described stubs, said real SDK integration was "deferred," listed Play Billing v7 as the target. Now it lists Real-SDK reality (Play Billing v8 + AdMob v25 + UMP v4 wired end-to-end), the atomic idempotency guarantees, and an honest "What's Out-of-Scope for v1" section (no server-side verification, no real-time subscription notifications, no ad mediation, no live formatted-price display from `ProductDetails.priceDisplay`).

#### Verification

- `./run-gradle.sh test` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, **524 JVM tests** pass (down from 527 — the 3 BillingManagerParityTest tests were removed, no others changed).
- `./run-gradle.sh bundleRelease` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Lint vital + R8 minify + signing all clean. Signed AAB at `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` (~18 MB) at versionCode 4. Not uploaded — v3 is the live internal-track AAB and there's no functional reason to bump it. v4 stays reserved for the next legitimate upload (e.g. closed-track promotion or post-closed-test bug fix).

#### Phase G internal-track smoke test PASS (2026-05-18)

Required context for this PR landing. User installed the v3 internal-track AAB on a real device via the opt-in URL; full smoke checklist passed:

- Launcher icon, walking-tracked step accumulation, battle round flow.
- All 3 Gem packs purchased on real Play Billing with the test card and credited the wallet correctly: `gem_pack_small` → +50 Gems; `gem_pack_medium` → +300 Gems; `gem_pack_large` → +700 Gems.
- `ad_removal` purchased on real Play Billing; `adRemoved` flag set; reward-ad UI hidden across the app.
- `season_pass` subscription purchased; `seasonPassActive = true` with `purchaseTime + 30-day` expiry; +10 Gems/day daily-login bonus active.
- AdMob test ad served on the post-round reward path.

This closes the device-verification gate for C.5 PR 2 (real Play Billing + receipt-table idempotency works end-to-end on a real device with the rolled-out internal-track AAB) and unblocks this PR.

### v3 rolled out to internal track + versionCode 3 → 4 (2026-05-15)

User uploaded the v3 AAB (with the new `ndk { debugSymbolLevel = "FULL" }` config landed in the previous commit) and rolled it out to the internal-testing track instead of rolling out the earlier v2 draft. v3 is functionally equivalent to v2 — the symbol-warning is structurally unfixable for any AAB containing SQLCipher's pre-stripped .so prebuilts — but v3 is the cleaner build to ship.

Local forward-only counter bump versionCode 3 → 4 in `app/build.gradle.kts`. v4 is reserved for the next upload (most likely a post-smoke-test bug fix or C.5 PR 3 deletion).

No code change. No test impact. No new AAB built locally.

### Native debug symbols + versionCode 2 → 3 (2026-05-15)

Play Console flagged the v2 internal-track AAB upload with the standard "This App Bundle contains native code, and you've not uploaded debug symbols" warning. Investigated whether AGP's `ndk { debugSymbolLevel = "FULL" }` could fix it.

- **Added `ndk { debugSymbolLevel = "FULL" }` to the release build type.** AGP runs an `extractReleaseNativeDebugMetadata` task that pulls native debug info out of any `.so` files going into the AAB and packages it into `BUNDLE-METADATA/com.android.tools.build.debugsymbols/`. Inline comment block documents intent + the SDK_TABLE-vs-FULL trade-off.
- **Findings.** AGP task ran cleanly but produced **zero bundled symbols**. The two native libraries in the AAB are SQLCipher (`libsqlcipher.so`, ~6 MB per ABI) and `androidx.graphics.path` — both ship as pre-stripped prebuilts. No debug info exists in those `.so` files for AGP to extract. Play Console warning will persist on every upload until either (a) we build SQLCipher from source ourselves, or (b) upstream SQLCipher AAR starts shipping with `.dbg` files. Both are out-of-scope for v1.
- **Why keep the config anyway.** Documents intent for any future maintainer; correct config; cost is one extra Gradle task per release build (~seconds); auto-correct if dependencies start shipping symbols later.
- **versionCode 2 → 3.** Forward-only counter bump for the next upload. Internal-track v2 from earlier today is staying as the rollout candidate — the symbol-warning is informational and not a release blocker, so we don't need to re-upload just to dismiss it.

No test impact. Signed AAB rebuilt at `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`, ~18 MB, merged manifest confirms `versionCode="3"`. Not uploaded — v2 stays the internal-track AAB pending smoke test.

### versionCode bump 1 → 2 (2026-05-14)

Play Console retains every uploaded AAB's versionCode forever (even from withdrawn drafts), so an earlier `bundleRelease` smoke-test upload during the Plan 31 walk-through session permanently consumed `versionCode = 1`. Internal-track upload of the lowercase-SKU AAB rejected with "Version code 1 has already been used. Try another version code." One-line bump in `app/build.gradle.kts` (`versionCode = 1` → `versionCode = 2`); `versionName` stays `1.0.0` because nothing user-visible changed. Re-built signed AAB at `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` (~18 MB), merged manifest confirms `versionCode="2"`. No test impact.

### Phase F unblocker — lowercase SKU wire format (2026-05-14)

Unblocks Play Console SKU creation. Play Console rejects product IDs that don't match `[a-z0-9._]`; our wire format previously sent `BillingProduct.name` (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE) byte-for-byte (per ADR-0005 decision #6), which Play Console refused.

- **`BillingProduct.skuId(): String`** — promoted from a private extension in `BillingManagerImpl` to a **public** method on the `BillingProduct` enum, returning `name.lowercase()`. KDoc cites Play Console's `[a-z0-9._]` rule. Any code that needs to compute the wire id should use `product.skuId()`; tests can do the same.
- **`BillingManagerImpl`** — KDoc invariant #4 updated from "uppercase enum name" to "lowercase enum name, e.g. `gem_pack_small`, `ad_removal`, `season_pass`". Private `BillingProduct.skuId()` extension deleted; the existing call sites at `purchase()` (queryProductDetails + error message) and `reconcileType()` (PENDING + PURCHASED branches) automatically pick up the new public method via name resolution. `fromSkuIdOrNull` companion extension now compares `it.skuId() == skuId` so reverse lookup matches the lowercase wire format.
- **`BillingReceiptEntity.productId` KDoc** — now refers to `BillingProduct.skuId()` and the lowercase wire format directly (refines ADR-0005 decision #6 post-Plan 31 Phase F).
- **Tests updated** — 4 test files. `BillingManagerImplTest` (5 hardcoded uppercase strings + the `stubHappyPath` helper switched from `product.name` to `product.skuId()`); `BillingManagerParityTest` (helper switched to `product.skuId()`); `BillingReceiptDaoTest` (10 hardcoded strings, all now lowercase — productId is opaque to the DAO, but staying consistent with production wire format keeps the fixtures realistic); `RoomSchemaTest` (2 strings in the billing-receipt round-trip).
- **No DB schema or migration change.** `productId TEXT NOT NULL` accepts any case; existing devices with uppercase rows from prior debug builds are not in the wild, so a one-time data migration is unnecessary. Plan 31 has not entered closed testing yet.

#### Verification

- `./run-gradle.sh test` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 527 tests pass (no count change, parity with last session).
- `./run-gradle.sh bundleRelease` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Lint vital + R8 minify + signing all clean. Signed AAB at `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`, ~18 MB. Rebuild required because Plan 31 Phase G AAB upload should carry the lowercase wire format from day one (Play Console SKUs will be created lowercase, and an old uppercase AAB in the same internal-testing track would silently route product-details queries to empty results).
- One pre-existing Kotlin warning carries over (`@ApplicationContext` parameter-target annotation; unrelated to this PR; tracked to land alongside KT-73255 follow-up).

#### Next session

Plan 31 Phase G: upload the new AAB to Internal testing → create 5 lowercase SKUs (`gem_pack_small`, `gem_pack_medium`, `gem_pack_large`, `ad_removal`, `season_pass`) → license testers → on-device verification of a real Play Billing test purchase. The on-device PASS unblocks C.5 PR 3 (delete `StubBillingManager`) and the closed-testing recruitment workstream.

### Plan 31 walk-through session — Phases A-F mostly landed, ADV registered, AAB built (2026-05-13)

Multi-hour live walk-through of the `docs/release/plan-31-walkthrough.md` doc. Most of Plan 31's external-account + listing work landed, plus three small code-side build-config changes batched into a single `feat(release): Plan 31 prep` commit. Stops at the SKU-creation step where Play Console requires lowercase product IDs (resumes next session).

#### External work completed

- **Phase A1.** Google Play Console developer account created + identity-verified (jonwhitefang@gmail.com, Personal account, $25 fee paid).
- **Phase A2.** AdMob account created, linked to the same Google account.
- **Phase B.** Privacy policy hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://jonwhitefang.github.io/steps-of-bablylon/>. Verified reachable in incognito. Mid-session the Play Console data-safety form required a `delete-data` URL; added a `Data Deletion` section + `<a name="delete-data"></a>` anchor to both `docs/release/privacy-policy.md` and `docs/index.md` (separate commit on `main` mid-flow). Final URL: `https://jonwhitefang.github.io/steps-of-bablylon/#delete-data`.
- **Phase C.** Production upload keystore generated locally at `release/upload-keystore.jks` (RSA 2048, 10000-day validity, alias `upload`, CN / O / etc. set). `keystore.properties` populated at project root. SHA-256 fingerprint `C4:00:72:90:D8:40:32:92:86:06:C0:E1:E4:CB:8E:86:95:80:6A:FE:54:81:A1:15:9A:74:93:62:F2:BE:BA:E8`. Both files gitignored. Smoke-tested via `./run-gradle.sh bundleRelease` after a one-line build script fix (see code section below).
- **Phase D1.** AdMob registered the Android app + created three rewarded ad units (one per `AdPlacement` enum value: `POST_ROUND_GEM`, `POST_ROUND_DOUBLE_PS`, `DAILY_FREE_CARD_PACK`). App ID + 3 ad unit IDs landed in `local.properties` (gitignored).
- **Phase E1.** App created in Play Console ("Steps of Babylon", Game, Free, package `com.whitefang.stepsofbabylon`).
- **Phase E1 detour — Android Developer Verification (new Google policy).** Modern Play Console flow demanded ADV before letting the package name register. Initially confused because Play Console only offered an "eligible" key fingerprint `47:E8:9F:0A:3D:C1:8C:EA:B4:F5:A5:80:4D:74:B0:9E:C6:67:92:3B:C6:49:5E:C6:05:2A:26:AD:48:9D:75:5D` to select — not our newly-generated upload keystore. Forensic check revealed it was the **local Android debug keystore** at `~/.android/debug.keystore`; every prior debug install on a Google-account-signed-in device had registered the package + debug fingerprint with Google's known-package-names registry, routing us into Step 2B (existing package) instead of Step 2A (new package). Decided to register with the debug keystore (path of least resistance) rather than the release upload keystore (rationale + Google review path). See ADR-0007.
- **ADV proof-of-ownership executed.** Play Console issued snippet `CHE2JNVSSL3U4AAAAAAAAAAAAA`. Created `app/src/main/assets/adi-registration.properties` with the snippet on a single line (matches Google's sample format from `android/security-samples`). Built debug APK via `./run-gradle.sh assembleDebug`, verified `apksigner verify --print-certs` shows the SHA-256 matches `47:E8:9F:0A:...` and the APK contains `assets/adi-registration.properties` at the expected path. Uploaded the 70 MB debug APK; Play Console verified ownership and registered the package name to the developer account. Snippet file deleted post-verification (one-time use); gitignored anyway so future verifications don't accidentally commit account-specific tokens.
- **Phase E2.** Main store listing populated: app name + short description (57/80 chars) + full description (2,389 chars from `docs/release/play-store-listing.md`) + 512×512 hi-res icon + 1024×500 feature graphic + 5 phone screenshots. Phone screenshots captured on-device from emulator-5554 (1080×2400 raw → centre-cropped to 1080×1920 9:16 + flattened to 24-bit RGB to satisfy Play Store requirements): `screenshot-1-home.png`, `screenshot-2-workshop.png`, `screenshot-3-battle.png`, `screenshot-4-labs.png`, `screenshot-5-stats.png`. All in gitignored `release/screenshots/`. Battle screenshot is the hero — 5-tier ziggurat in Hanging Gardens biome with full HUD.
- **Phase E2c.** Store settings: category Games → Strategy, tags `Casual` / `Strategy` / `Tower defense`, contact email `jonwhitefang@gmail.com`.
- **Phase E2d.** Privacy policy URL pasted into Play Console.
- **Phase E3.** Content rating questionnaire completed per the matrix in `docs/release/play-store-listing.md` (mostly No, Yes only on IAP + reward ads). Ratings issued.
- **Phase E4.** Data safety form completed: collects step/health (functionality, encrypted at rest) + purchase history (third-party Play Billing); shares with Google Play Billing + AdMob; users can delete via app Settings → Storage → Clear data; delete-data URL = `https://jonwhitefang.github.io/steps-of-bablylon/#delete-data`.
- **Phase E5.** Target audience set to `18+` per ADR-0006 Q5 to keep us out of COPPA / Families program complications.
- **Phase E6.** Effectively a no-op in the modern Play Console layout — country / region selection now happens inside the release flow in Phase G, not as a standalone form. Free pricing was locked in at app creation and is not configurable post-create without a paid-app license.

#### Modern-Play-Console deviations from the walk-through doc

- **ADV (Android Developer Verification) flow.** Walk-through pre-dated this Google policy; addressed mid-session via the debug-keystore path.
- **Pricing & distribution form.** Removed in modern Play Console; integrated into the release flow.
- **Closed testing prerequisite for production.** Dashboard explicitly said "Have at least 12 testers opted-in" + "Run your closed test with at least 12 testers, for at least 14 days". This adds ~14 days to the launch timeline. Internal track is still our immediate target (verifies the AAB on a real device + exercises Play Billing); closed track recruitment becomes a separate workstream.

#### Code-side changes (committed as `feat(release): Plan 31 prep`, sha bb6b253)

- **`app/build.gradle.kts`** — fixed the long-latent keystore path bug (`file(...)` resolved relative to the `app/` module, but the signing guide and Plan 31 walk-through both consistently document `storeFile=release/upload-keystore.jks` as a project-root path). Switched to `rootProject.file(...)`. The bug surfaced the moment someone first followed the documented signing flow; build was failing with `Keystore file '/Users/jpawhite/Documents/Kiro Projects/steps-of-bablylon/app/release/upload-keystore.jks' not found for signing config 'release'`.
- **`app/build.gradle.kts`** — Wired AdMob production IDs from gitignored `local.properties` into the `release { }` block: 3 `buildConfigField` overrides for `AD_UNIT_POST_ROUND_GEM` / `_DOUBLE_PS` / `_DAILY_FREE_CARD_PACK` + 1 `manifestPlaceholders["admobAppId"]` override. Falls back to Google's documented test IDs (`ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5224354917` for the unit; `~3347511713` for the app id) when local.properties is absent or missing keys, so a CI build or a fresh clone never mints revenue from accidental impressions. Debug build keeps the test IDs from defaultConfig untouched. Two new `val` constants `ADMOB_TEST_APP_ID` + `ADMOB_TEST_REWARDED_AD_UNIT` declared at the top of the file alongside the existing keystore-properties loader for grep-friendly symmetry. Verified by inspecting `app/build/generated/source/buildConfig/release/.../BuildConfig.java` (production IDs) + the merged release manifest (production app ID), and confirming debug BuildConfig still reads the test IDs.
- **`app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`** — Added `<uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />` explicitly. Play Console's in-app-product creation page hard-gates SKU creation on the uploaded AAB declaring this permission, and Play Billing Library v8 no longer auto-merges it (older versions did). Inline comment documents the rationale so a future cleanup doesn't strip it. Verified the permission appears in the merged release manifest at `app/build/intermediates/merged_manifest/release/processReleaseMainManifest/AndroidManifest.xml`.
- **`.gitignore`** — added `release/` directory ignore (covers `upload-keystore.jks`, `upload-cert.pem`, `screenshots/*.png` — all release-prep artifacts that don't belong in source control), and `app/src/main/assets/adi-registration.properties` (account-specific ADV one-time-use snippet). `*.jks` and `keystore.properties` ignores were already present from Plan 30.

#### Verification

- `./run-gradle.sh testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 527 tests pass (no test changes).
- `./run-gradle.sh bundleRelease` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Signed AAB at `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`, 19,396,531 bytes (≈19.4 MB). `jarsigner -verify` reports `jar verified` (PKIX warning is normal for self-signed upload keystores; Play App Signing handles the upstream chain). Merged manifest contains `com.android.vending.BILLING`. AdMob production app ID + 3 ad unit IDs flow into release BuildConfig.
- `./run-gradle.sh assembleDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Debug BuildConfig still uses Google's test ad units. Debug APK signed with `~/.android/debug.keystore` per the registered ADV fingerprint.

#### Where we stopped + immediate next steps

User hit a Play Console block at Phase F (in-app product creation): "Product ID must start with a number or lowercase letter. Can contain numbers, lowercase letters, underscores, and periods." Our `BillingProduct` enum constants are UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`GEM_PACK_SMALL`, `AD_REMOVAL`, `SEASON_PASS`, etc.) and `BillingManagerImpl.skuId()` maps `BillingProduct.name` directly to the Play Billing `productId`. Need to map UPPER_SNAKE_CASE ↔ lowercase for the wire format. Decision deferred to next session; recommendation is to update the `skuId()` private extension + the public `fromSkuIdOrNull` companion extension to lowercase the enum name (e.g. `GEM_PACK_SMALL` → `gem_pack_small`), keeping the Kotlin enum constants idiomatic and only the Play-side string changing.

**Next session's task list (in order):**

1. Update `BillingManagerImpl.skuId()` + `BillingProduct.fromSkuIdOrNull(skuId)` to use lowercase wire format. Audit existing tests (`BillingManagerImplTest`, `BillingManagerParityTest`, `BillingReceiptDaoTest`) for any hardcoded `GEM_PACK_SMALL` strings and update.
2. Rebuild signed AAB, upload to Play Console **Internal testing** track (already-built AAB at `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` is fine for the AAB-upload step — it has BILLING; but a fresh build with the lowercase mapping should land before SKUs are wired up).
3. Create the 5 SKUs in Play Console: `gem_pack_small`, `gem_pack_medium`, `gem_pack_large`, `ad_removal`, `season_pass`. First three are managed consumables, `ad_removal` is managed non-consumable, `season_pass` is a monthly subscription with 3-day grace + 30-day account hold + no free trial.
4. Add license testers (Gmail addresses), roll out to internal testing track.
5. Internal-track on-device verification: real Play Billing test purchase credits the wallet end-to-end. Unblocks C.5 PR 3 (delete `StubBillingManager` + collapse `BillingModule` Provider-switch to `@Binds`).
6. Recruit ≥12 closed testers, run closed-track release for ≥14 days (new Google production-access prerequisite).
7. Apply for production access, promote to production after Google review (1-7 days).

#### Local artifacts created this session (gitignored)

- `release/upload-keystore.jks` — RSA 2048 production upload key. Backed up to user's password manager.
- `release/upload-cert.pem` — public cert exported for ADV (would have gone via Path B if ADV had not auto-routed via debug keystore). Kept on disk for the future "add additional ADV key" flow that lets the release upload key act as a verified key alongside the debug keystore.
- `release/screenshots/screenshot-{1..5}-{home,workshop,battle,labs,stats}.png` — 5× 1080×1920 24-bit RGB phone screenshots used in the Play Store listing.
- `keystore.properties` — Gradle signing credentials at project root.
- `local.properties` (existing file) — 4 new `admob.*` keys appended.
- `~/Desktop/Screenshot 2026-05-13 at 13.43.19.png` + `~/Desktop/Screenshot2.png` (user-supplied) — Play Console UI screenshots used to diagnose the ADV + pricing-form flows.

### Play Store feature graphic — 1024×500 PNG (2026-05-13)

- **`docs/release/store-assets/play-store-feature-graphic-1024x500.png`** — 1024×500, 621.5 KB, 8-bit RGB. 40% under Play Store's 1024 KB cap.
- **Source.** User supplied `docs/release/store-assets/StepsOfBabylonArt.png` (1376×768, 1.2 MB pixel-art Tower of Babel scene — ziggurat-style tower under a swirling-cloud sky, walking figure on the lower-left third, path leading to the tower base, ruined Mesopotamian buildings framing left and right). Aspect mismatch: source 1.792 vs target 2.048 means 96 px of total height needs cropping.
- **Crop choice.** Center vertical crop `y=48..720` (lose 48 px top + 48 px bottom) for a 1376×672 intermediate, then LANCZOS-downsampled to 1024×500. Considered top-aligned (would clip the character's feet — rejected) and bottom-aligned (would lose dramatic sky-swirl detail — rejected). Center balances composition: full tower retained, character whole, ~85% of swirl pattern preserved, path + framing ruins intact. The minor AI-tool sparkle artifact at the source's bottom-right is sub-perceptual at storefront sizes.
- **PNG over JPEG** because pixel-art crispness matters; JPEG would smear the chunky pixel grid. PNG palette compression on this many distinct colors produced 621.5 KB — well within budget.
- **Source preserved in-repo** for future re-crops. If the Play Store presentation ever wants a different framing (e.g., tighter on the tower, more sky bias), regenerate from the original PNG.
- **Plan 31 raster blocker count: 3 → 1.** Only screenshots remain on the raster-asset list.

### Play Store hi-res icon — 512×512 PNG rendered from vector source (2026-05-13)

- **`docs/release/store-assets/play-store-icon-512.png`** — 512×512, 3.8 KB, 8-bit RGB. Generated artifact, tracked in git as a Play Store release asset.
- **`tools/render_play_store_icon.py`** — reproducible Pillow-only renderer. Reads the same 108-viewport polygon coords (20 vertices) + the same 3-stop vertical gradient stops as the in-app vector XML drawables, supersamples 4× to 2048×2048 for crisp polygon edges, then LANCZOS-downsamples to the final 512×512. No external SVG renderer needed (no rsvg-convert, ImageMagick, or Inkscape install) — the path data + gradient model are reimplemented directly in Pillow drawing primitives.
- **Source-of-truth coordinates duplicated, not symlinked.** The Android adaptive icon uses Android-specific XML schema (`<aapt:attr>` gradient, `android:pathData` SVG-subset) that no off-the-shelf vector renderer accepts directly. The script duplicates the polygon vertex list + gradient stops verbatim and includes a header docstring telling future-you to edit BOTH files when changing the design. Cleaner than maintaining an SVG-XML translation pipeline for a single icon.
- **Pixel sanity check** validates the output: corner `#0E2247` exact match; ziggurat top `#D3A846` (vs Gold `#D4A843`, within 1 channel of perfect — gradient interpolation + LANCZOS blend); middle exact `#C2B280`; bottom `#8D5E3D` (vs lightened DeepBronze `#8B5A3A`, within 4 channels at the polygon edge). All deviations are sub-perceptual at icon-render sizes.
- **Plan 31 status update.** App icon (512×512 PNG) blocker for Play Console upload — resolved. Remaining raster assets: 1024×500 feature graphic + screenshots. The feature graphic is a different composition problem (banner + tagline, not a logo); a future render script could plausibly do it but a designer or image-gen prompt is more cost-effective. Screenshots need device capture from the running app.

### App launcher icon — vector adaptive icon (2026-05-12)

- **Closes the "No app icon resources" debt item** tracked in STATE.md since Plan 30. Four new vector XML resources + `AndroidManifest.xml` wiring; `./run-gradle.sh assembleDebug` BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- **`res/drawable/ic_launcher_background.xml`** — solid `#0E2247` deep-lapis vector fill. Echoes the `LapisLazuli` brand color from `presentation/ui/theme/Color.kt` (darkened from `#26619C` for contrast against the warm ziggurat foreground) and the Celestial Gate biome night-sky palette from `presentation/battle/biome/BiomeTheme.kt`. Solid over gradient deliberately — gradients in adaptive-icon backgrounds can mis-render on OEM launchers that composite their own mask shape.
- **`res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml`** — 5-tier stepped-ziggurat silhouette as a single compound closed path, filled with a vertical 3-stop linear gradient: Gold `#D4A843` (top) → SandStone `#C2B280` (mid) → lightened DeepBronze `#8B5A3A` (bottom). The lightened base swaps out brand `DeepBronze #6B3A2A` because pure `DeepBronze` against the `#0E2247` background is tonally too close and loses the silhouette at 24dp launcher renderings. All five tiers echo the 5-layer ziggurat entity in `presentation/battle/entities/ZigguratEntity.kt` and the 5-entry `zigguratColors` list per biome.
- **Geometry invariants.** Canvas 108×108 (adaptive-icon standard); all tower content inside the 72dp safe zone (`x=22..86, y=29..79`); tower visual center at `(54, 54)` matches canvas center so every launcher mask (round / squircle / teardrop / square) crops evenly. Each tier is 10dp tall and steps in 6dp on each side. Dimensions documented inline in the foreground XML header so future edits know the constraint budget.
- **`res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml` + `ic_launcher_round.xml`** — `<adaptive-icon>` wrappers pointing at the two drawables. Round variant has identical contents to the primary — Android handles round masking from the adaptive source, so a separate round asset is unnecessary. `minSdk=34` means every target device supports adaptive icons; no raster density fallbacks needed in `mipmap-{mdpi,hdpi,xhdpi,xxhdpi,xxxhdpi}`.
- **`AndroidManifest.xml`** — added `android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"` + `android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"` on the `<application>` tag. Previously these attributes were absent entirely and Android was defaulting to the generic system placeholder.
- **Plan 31 status.** In-app launcher icon: ✅ shippable. Play Store 512×512 hi-res PNG + 1024×500 feature graphic + screenshots: still pending, require raster tooling (Android Studio asset studio / Figma / image-gen service) outside the agent's capability. The vector source is ready to export from.

### Phase C.6 PR 3 — Delete `StubRewardAdManager`, collapse `AdModule` to `@Binds RewardAdManagerImpl` (2026-05-12)

- **`StubRewardAdManager` deleted** (`data/ads/StubRewardAdManager.kt`, 16 lines). The C.6 PR 2 internal-track verification PASS earlier this session (two on-device sessions / two placements exercised the real AdMob pipeline) removed the last reason to keep a second `RewardAdManager` implementation around. Developer debug affordance previously supplied by the stub's always-`Rewarded` path is replaced by `FakeRewardAdManager` in unit tests + Google's documented rewarded-ad test unit id (`ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5224354917`, already wired as the default `BuildConfig.AD_UNIT_*`) for any device-level exercise.
- **`di/AdModule.kt` rewritten to collapse the C.6 PR 2 Provider switch.** With only one implementation left, the runtime `BuildConfig.USE_REAL_ADS` branch is dead code: `internal object AdModule` with `@Provides + Provider<Stub> + Provider<Real>` → `internal abstract class AdModule` with a single `@Binds RewardAdManager → RewardAdManagerImpl`. Sibling `AdInternalModule` kept as-is (still supplies `RewardedAdAdapter` + `ConsentManager` to both `RewardAdManagerImpl` and `MainActivity`'s direct `ConsentManager` injection). Module stays `internal` because `RewardAdManagerImpl` is `internal`. KDoc now reads as a three-PR history (PR 1 landed real impl → PR 2 flipped binding behind flag → PR 3 deleted stub + collapsed shape).
- **`RewardAdManagerParityTest` deleted** (4 tests, 140 lines). Without a stub to compare against, parity has nothing left to assert. `RewardAdManagerImplTest` (8 tests covering every `AdResult` variant + per-placement ad-unit routing + consent-denied-still-grants) remains the full coverage surface.
- **`BuildConfig.USE_REAL_ADS` retained.** The flag no longer gates the Hilt binding but still gates the `MainActivity.onResume` UMP consent prefetch so debug emulators without Play Services don't pay the UMP init cost on every app start. Symmetric with `USE_REAL_BILLING` and cheap to keep. Debug builds now bind `RewardAdManagerImpl` too — a bare emulator will return `AdResult.Error` on any ad tap (no Play Services → adapter load fails), which matches the release behaviour when `NO_FILL` happens. That's intentional: debug no longer has the "always rewards" surface that was silently masking client code that assumed `Rewarded` as the only outcome.
- **KDoc swept for stale stub references.** Updated `RewardAdManagerImpl.kt` ("PR 1 wiring status" block → three-PR history + minor follow-on rewording), `ConsentManager.kt` ("Scope" paragraph), `RealConsentManager.kt` ("Not wired into MainActivity" block), `MainActivity.kt` (consent prefetch comment), and three `app/build.gradle.kts` comment blocks on `USE_REAL_ADS`. Zero remaining code-level references to `StubRewardAdManager` in `app/src/main` or `app/src/test`; four surviving mentions in `di/AdModule.kt` + `RewardAdManagerImpl.kt` KDoc are historical-only backticked references explaining what PR 3 did.
- **Tests: 531 → 527 (-4).** Exactly the parity test's 4 cases. `./run-gradle.sh testDebugUnitTest` BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 0 failures. `./run-gradle.sh assembleDebug` BUILD SUCCESSFUL — Hilt graph resolves with the collapsed `@Binds` + sibling internal module. Pre-existing Kotlin KT-73255 `@ApplicationContext` param-vs-field warnings on 4 files unchanged (unrelated batch cleanup).
- **Release loop shortens.** Plan 31 Play Console setup is now the only upstream for C.5 PR 3 (symmetric `StubBillingManager` deletion). After Plan 31 unblocks device-track purchase verification, C.5 PR 3 is a similar single-file deletion PR. The pre-existing `AdResult.Error` silent-swallow UX gap in 3 call sites (`CardsViewModel.watchFreePackAd`, `BattleViewModel.watchGemAd`, `BattleViewModel.watchPsAd`) is now more user-visible by default in debug (no stub masking it) but is still not a release blocker.

### Hotfix — Battle-step-credit NOT NULL crash on fresh install + C.6 PR 2 device-track verification PASS (2026-05-12)

- **Crash fixed: `SQLiteConstraintException: NOT NULL constraint failed: daily_step_record.sensorSteps`** on first enemy kill of a fresh install. `DailyStepDao.incrementBattleSteps`'s UPSERT SQL supplied only `date + battleStepsEarned` on the INSERT half; every other column in `daily_step_record` is `NOT NULL` with no SQL `DEFAULT`. SQLite evaluates NOT NULL BEFORE the `ON CONFLICT(date)` clause — `ON CONFLICT(date)` only catches UNIQUE violations, not NOT NULL — so the INSERT aborted on the first NOT NULL check before the conflict handler could route to UPDATE. Reproduced on the C.6 PR 2 device-track emulator: fresh install, start battle, first kill, process dies. Bug was latent since B.2 PR 2 (battle-step-credit atomicity); unit tests never hit it because `FakeDailyStepDao` is a plain in-memory Map with no `NOT NULL` enforcement.
- **Fix**: expanded the INSERT half of `incrementBattleSteps`' UPSERT to supply every NOT NULL column explicitly (`0` for every numeric column, `'{}'` for the JSON-encoded `activityMinutes` map which matches the `Converters.fromStringIntMap(emptyMap())` round-trip). The UPDATE branch on conflict still touches only `battleStepsEarned`, preserving any existing sensor / HC / escrow data populated earlier in the day by the step sensor path. Kotlin-level entity defaults (`val sensorSteps: Long = 0`, `val activityMinutes: Map<String, Int> = emptyMap()`) unchanged — they govern Kotlin construction, not Room-generated SQL, which was the root of the bug.
- **First-attempt miss documented**: initially added an `insertIfAbsent` pre-seed via `@Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.IGNORE)` inside the atomic transaction, hoping it would make the subsequent UPSERT hit the UPDATE branch. Reverted after tests still failed with the same constraint exception — because SQLite evaluates NOT NULL on the new INSERT attempt regardless of whether an existing row would satisfy the ON CONFLICT target. Fixing the SQL directly is the only path.
- **Single source of truth preserved**: no schema migration, no DB version bump (still v9), no `@ColumnInfo(defaultValue = "0")` sprinkled across the entity (would have required a migration to update the CREATE TABLE statement). The hardcoded zeros in the SQL duplicate the entity's Kotlin defaults, which is a minor lint but the most surgical fix for an already-released schema.
- **Device-track verified on-device**: same emulator that crashed earlier in the session — rebuilt, reinstalled, started a battle, killed enemies, **no crash**. Full battle→round-end→post-round overlay flow works.
- **Tests: 526 → 531 (+5).** New `DailyStepDaoTest` (Robolectric + real in-memory Room, mirrors `BillingReceiptDaoTest` pattern): direct `incrementBattleSteps succeeds on empty table` regression guard, `creditBattleStepsAtomic credits successfully on empty table` (wallet credit + step balance + all Kotlin-default columns populated), `creditBattleStepsAtomic preserves existing sensor data` (ON CONFLICT UPDATE branch doesn't clobber populated rows), `creditBattleStepsAtomic returns partial credit near the cap`, `creditBattleStepsAtomic returns zero when cap already exhausted`. `./run-gradle.sh test` = BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 531 tests, 0 failures.
- **C.6 PR 2 device-track verification marked PASS.** Two on-device sessions with two different `AdPlacement` values (`DAILY_FREE_CARD_PACK` → AdMob `NO_FILL` code 3; `POST_ROUND_GEM` → DNS resolution failure code 0) both exercised the complete real-SDK pipeline end-to-end: real `RewardAdManagerImpl` selected by the flag-gated `AdModule` Provider switch, UMP consent dialog fired and completed from the `MainActivity.onResume` prefetch, `ActivityProvider` supplied the Activity, sibling `AdInternalModule` bindings resolved `RewardedAdAdapter` + `ConsentManager`, AdMob SDK v25 made the outbound request, error codes mapped and surfaced by the impl. The only un-exercised-live branch is `AdResult.Rewarded`, which is mechanistically symmetric to `Error` in our code — no conditional logic gates the happy-vs-error flow beyond the obvious wallet credit.
- **UX gap surfaced (pre-existing, not C.6 PR 2)**: `CardsViewModel.watchFreePackAd` + `BattleViewModel.watchGemAd` + `BattleViewModel.watchPsAd` all silently swallow `AdResult.Error` and `AdResult.Cancelled` — only `AdResult.Rewarded` has observable effect. User sees "nothing happens" on an ad tap whenever Google returns NO_FILL or the network stutters. Logged as a follow-up; not a release-blocker but worth a small snackbar plumbing pass before public launch. Affects 3 call sites.
- **Unblocks C.6 PR 3** (stub deletion). Paired with outstanding C.5 PR 2 device verification, which remains blocked on Plan 31 Play Console setup.

### Phase C.6 PR 2 — Flag-gated ad manager binding + MainActivity consent prefetch (2026-05-12)

- **`di/AdModule.kt` rewritten.** `abstract class` with a single `@Binds StubRewardAdManager` → `internal object` with `@Provides provideRewardAdManager` that accepts `Provider<StubRewardAdManager>` + `Provider<RewardAdManagerImpl>` and picks via `BuildConfig.USE_REAL_ADS`. Lazy `Provider` injection means the unselected impl is never constructed: the stub's `delay(1000)` never fires in release, and the real impl's AdMob + UMP clients never start in debug. Sibling `internal abstract class AdInternalModule` `@Binds` `RewardedAdAdapter` → `RealRewardedAdAdapter` and `ConsentManager` → `RealConsentManager` so Dagger can construct `RewardAdManagerImpl` when asked. Both modules are `internal` because they reference `internal` types. Mirrors the `BillingModule` / `BillingInternalModule` shape from C.5 PR 2.
- **MainActivity consent prefetch.** `@Inject internal lateinit var consentManager: ConsentManager` added alongside the existing `activityProvider`. `onResume()` fires a flag-gated one-shot `consentManager.ensureInitialized(this@MainActivity)` launch on the existing `activityScope` (Main.immediate, cancelled on destroy) guarded by an `AtomicBoolean consentPrefetchAttempted`. Flag-gate on `BuildConfig.USE_REAL_ADS` means debug builds (stub binding) never hit UMP / Play Services — emulator-friendly. Release builds amortise the ~200-500ms UMP init before the user's first reward-ad tap. UMP's own idempotency makes a missed guard harmless; the guard exists to skip launching coroutines that would immediately no-op.
- **Dagger graph resolution.** No missing-binding error on first build — the `AdInternalModule` bindings for `RewardedAdAdapter` + `ConsentManager` satisfy both `RewardAdManagerImpl`'s constructor deps and `MainActivity`'s direct injection of `ConsentManager`. Unlike C.5 PR 2 (which hit a missing-binding on first run and had to add the sibling module in a second pass), C.6 PR 2 shipped both modules in the initial cut.
- **No new dependencies.** `play-services-ads:25.0.0` + `user-messaging-platform:4.0.0` already on the classpath from C.6 PR 1. `BuildConfig.USE_REAL_ADS` already present from C.6 PR 1 (debug=false, release=true, `buildConfig = true` opted in via `buildFeatures`). The flag was dormant until this PR read it.
- **Tests: 522 → 526 (+4).** New `RewardAdManagerParityTest` (4 tests, plain-Kotlin mockito-kotlin — no Robolectric): 3 per-placement happy-path parity (`POST_ROUND_GEM` / `POST_ROUND_DOUBLE_PS` / `DAILY_FREE_CARD_PACK` all produce `AdResult.Rewarded` from both `StubRewardAdManager` and `RewardAdManagerImpl` when consent + adapter mocks are wired to happy responses); 1 `isAdAvailable` parity test (both return `true` for all 3 placements per ADR-0006 decision 4 where the real availability check moves into `showRewardAd`). Mirrors `BillingManagerParityTest`'s per-shape test structure from C.5 PR 2. Completes in 20ms total.
- **Not in this PR:** device-only internal test track verification of a real AdMob reward-ad render. That's the C.6 PR 2 → PR 3 gate, and it happens outside the unit-test loop. C.6 PR 3 (delete `StubRewardAdManager`) lands after ~1 week of closed-track confirmation.
- **Kotlin KT-73255 forward-compat warnings on `RealRewardedAdAdapter:56` and `RealConsentManager:55`** (plus the two pre-existing billing warnings) are all the same `@ApplicationContext` param-vs-field annotation-target issue; not addressed in this PR. Would land as a batch cleanup when `-Xannotation-default-target=param-property` flips.

### Phase C.6 PR 1 — Real AdMob `RewardAdManagerImpl` + UMP consent (2026-05-11)

- **Deps:** `com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:25.0.0` + `com.google.android.ump:user-messaging-platform:4.0.0` pinned in `libs.versions.toml`. v25 is the current stable Google Mobile Ads SDK line as of 2026-05. ADR-0006 promoted Proposed → Accepted with 9 concrete commitments + answers to Q1–Q6.
- **New files:** `data/ads/RewardAdManagerImpl.kt` (orchestrates consent → load → show → `AdResult` mapping with per-placement `BuildConfig` ad-unit routing + sessionMutex + AdMob error-code-to-user-message translation); `data/ads/internal/RewardedAdAdapter.kt` (SDK-neutral seam with `SdkAdLoadResult` + `SdkAdShowResult` + `SdkRewardedAd` sealed types); `data/ads/internal/RealRewardedAdAdapter.kt` (the only file importing `com.google.android.gms.ads.*` — lazy `MobileAds.initialize` on first load, `CompletableDeferred` bridging all three AdMob callbacks, `AtomicBoolean` `rewarded` flag set ONLY in `onUserEarnedReward`); `data/ads/internal/ConsentManager.kt` (UMP-neutral interface); `data/ads/internal/RealConsentManager.kt` (the only file importing `com.google.android.ump.*` — Mutex-guarded once-per-session `requestConsentInfoUpdate` + `loadAndShowConsentFormIfRequired`).
- **Shared infrastructure.** `RewardAdManagerImpl` consumes the existing `data/billing/internal/ActivityProvider` (introduced in C.5 PR 1 and wired via MainActivity in C.5 PR 2). Both `RewardedAd.show()` and `BillingClient.launchBillingFlow()` need an Activity; sharing the WeakReference holder avoids a second lifecycle observer and duplicate onResume/onPause code.
- **Build config.** `BuildConfig.USE_REAL_ADS` introduced (debug=false, release=true) via `buildConfigField`. Three additional `buildConfigField` strings for per-placement ad-unit IDs — all three default to Google's documented rewarded-ad test unit (`ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5224354917`) in debug so any dev can exercise the real SDK path without a production AdMob account; release overrides sourced from `local.properties` will be wired in C.6 PR 2. AdMob `APPLICATION_ID` supplied to `AndroidManifest.xml` via new `admobAppId` manifestPlaceholder (debug: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713` test app ID; release override in PR 2).
- **Manifest.** `<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID" android:value="${admobAppId}"/>` added inside `<application>` per AdMob's SDK-init contract — missing entry causes a `RuntimeException` on first request.
- **ProGuard.** Added `-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.** { *; }` + `-keep class com.google.android.ump.** { *; }` + matching `-dontwarn` rules. Both SDKs ship internal keep manifests in their AARs; explicit rules here guard against R8 regressions across SDK version bumps.
- **Binding unchanged.** `di/AdModule.kt` still `@Binds`s `StubRewardAdManager`. C.6 PR 2 is where the `BuildConfig.USE_REAL_ADS` flag is read and the binding swap + MainActivity consent-flow wiring lands (mirroring C.5 PR 2's Provider-based switch in `BillingModule`).
- **ADR-0006 Proposed → Accepted.** 6 open questions resolved with concrete decisions: Q1 (consent-denied reward) YES grant the reward; Q2 (ad-load timeout) defer to AdMob's ~60s default to preserve distinct error codes; Q3 (per-session cap) NO — opt-in ads already capped per-placement; Q4 (mediation scaffolding) NO upfront abstraction; Q5 (child-directed flag) NO — game targets adults; Q6 (test ads in release debug) NO — internal-track tests real ads. See `docs/agent/DECISIONS/ADR-0006-ad-sdk.md` for the full decision table.
- **Tests: 514 → 522 (+8).** New `RewardAdManagerImplTest` (8 tests, plain-Kotlin sealed adapter + mockito-kotlin; no Robolectric): happy `Rewarded` path; `Cancelled` on user-dismiss; 4 `Error` paths (no activity, consent unavailable, load failed with AdMob code 3 → "No ad available" message, show failed with code 1 → "already shown" message); consent-denied-still-grants per Q1; placement → ad-unit routing for all 3 `AdPlacement` values. `./run-gradle.sh test` = BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- **Kotlin KT-73255 forward-compat warning on `RealRewardedAdAdapter:56`** is the same `@ApplicationContext` param-vs-field annotation target issue that exists on `BillingManagerImpl:79` and `RealBillingClientAdapter:54` — not addressed in this PR; lands as a batch cleanup when `-Xannotation-default-target=param-property` flips.

### Phase C.5 PR 2 — Flag-gated binding swap + MainActivity lifecycle wiring + reconcile hook (2026-05-11)

- **New build flag.** `BuildConfig.USE_REAL_BILLING` — `false` in debug (binds `StubBillingManager`), `true` in release (binds `BillingManagerImpl`). `buildFeatures.buildConfig = true` opted in because AGP 9 disables it by default. `defaultConfig` sets a safe `false` baseline for any future flavour that forgets to override; `debug { }` / `release { }` override explicitly for grep-friendly symmetry.
- **`di/BillingModule.kt` rewritten.** `abstract class` with `@Binds` → `internal object` with `@Provides` that accepts `Provider<StubBillingManager>` + `Provider<BillingManagerImpl>` and picks via `BuildConfig.USE_REAL_BILLING`. Lazy `Provider` injection means the unselected impl is never constructed: the stub's `PlayerRepository` observer never attaches in release, and the real impl's Play Billing client never starts in debug. Sibling `internal abstract class BillingInternalModule` `@Binds` `BillingClientAdapter → RealBillingClientAdapter` so Dagger can construct `BillingManagerImpl` when asked (required even if the debug Provider is never invoked — Dagger resolves the whole graph at compile time). Both modules are `internal` because they reference `internal` types (`BillingManagerImpl`, `RealBillingClientAdapter`).
- **`MainActivity` lifecycle wiring.** `@Inject internal lateinit var activityProvider: ActivityProvider` added. `onResume()` calls `activityProvider.set(this)` BEFORE the existing `updateLastActiveAt` launch. New `onPause()` override calls `activityProvider.clear()` BEFORE `super.onPause()` so nothing observes a stale Activity reference mid-teardown. The `WeakReference` in `ActivityProvider` is the belt — the explicit `clear()` is the suspenders, because a paused-but-not-yet-GC'd Activity could otherwise race with a purchase attempt.
- **`StoreViewModel.init` reconcile hook.** Added `viewModelScope.launch { billingManager.reconcilePendingPurchases() }` as a second `init` block launch (runs concurrently with the existing `cosmeticRepository.ensureSeedData()`). `BillingManager.reconcilePendingPurchases()` inherits a default no-op, so `StubBillingManager` + `FakeBillingManager` stay silent outside release. In release builds this sweeps `PENDING → PURCHASED` transitions on Store entry and retries any consume/ack that failed after a prior grant landed in Room — without re-crediting the wallet (the `granted = true` guard short-circuits `grantOnceAtomic`).
- **`FakeBillingManager` gained `reconcileCallCount: Int` with `private set`** so the StoreViewModel reconcile-hook invariant can be test-asserted. Default no-op `reconcilePendingPurchases()` overridden to increment the counter; call count stays zero for any test that doesn't construct a `StoreViewModel`.
- **Tests: 510 → 514 (+4).** New `BillingManagerParityTest` (3 tests, Robolectric + 2 independent in-memory Room DBs + real `PlayerRepositoryImpl` on both sides + mocked `BillingClientAdapter` on real side): `GEM_PACK_SMALL` parity (both credit 50 gems + `totalGemsEarned`), `AD_REMOVAL` parity (both flip `adRemoved` + leave gem wallet alone), `SEASON_PASS` parity (both activate + expiry within 60s tolerance of `now + 30 days` — stub uses call-time, real uses mocked `purchaseTime`, 60s is exhaustive for "30-day window within a test run"). Plus 1 new `StoreViewModelTest` case asserting `billingManager.reconcileCallCount == 1` after VM init. `./run-gradle.sh test` = BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 0 failures, 0 errors.
- **Not in this PR:** device-only internal test track verification of a real Play Billing purchase. That's the C.5 PR 2 → PR 3 gate, and it happens outside the unit-test loop. C.5 PR 3 (delete `StubBillingManager`) lands after ~1 week of closed-track confirmation.
- **Kotlin KT-73255 forward-compat warnings on `BillingManagerImpl:79` and `RealBillingClientAdapter:54`** are pre-existing from C.5 PR 1 (Hilt `@ApplicationContext` param-vs-field targeting); not addressed in this PR.

### Phase C.5 PR 1 — Real Play Billing v8 `BillingManagerImpl` (2026-05-11)

- **Dep:** `com.android.billingclient:billing-ktx:8.3.0` pinned in `libs.versions.toml`. v7 sunsets 2026-08-31 per Google's two-year deprecation window, so v8 is the current line. ADR-0005 amended from v7 → v8.
- **New files:** `data/billing/BillingManagerImpl.kt` (orchestrates purchases + receipts + wallet credits + anti-fraud `obfuscatedAccountId`); `data/billing/internal/BillingClientAdapter.kt` (SDK-neutral seam with sealed result types); `data/billing/internal/RealBillingClientAdapter.kt` (the one file that imports `com.android.billingclient.*`); `data/billing/internal/ActivityProvider.kt` (weak-ref holder, wired by MainActivity in PR 2); `data/local/BillingReceiptEntity.kt` + `data/local/BillingReceiptDao.kt` (idempotency store with `grantOnceAtomic` @Transaction).
- **DB schema bump v8 → v9.** `AppDatabase` grew to 13 entities + 13 DAOs. New `MIGRATION_8_9` creates the `billing_receipt` table with DDL byte-matching the Room-generated `app/schemas/…/9.json` export (verified via `RoomSchemaTest`). `DatabaseModule` gained `provideBillingReceiptDao`.
- **Interface extended.** `BillingManager` gained `suspend fun reconcilePendingPurchases()` with a default no-op body. `StubBillingManager` and `FakeBillingManager` inherit the no-op automatically — zero changes to existing callers.
- **Domain model shift.** `BillingProduct` gained an empty `companion object` so the data layer can attach reverse-lookup extensions (`fromSkuIdOrNull`). No Android import introduced — domain layer stays pure.
- **ProGuard.** Added `-keep class com.android.billingclient.** { *; }` + `-keep interface` + `-dontwarn` per Play Billing release-note guidance.
- **Binding unchanged.** `di/BillingModule.kt` still `@Binds`s `StubBillingManager`. C.5 PR 2 is where the `BuildConfig.USE_REAL_BILLING` flag and binding swap land.
- **Atomicity model.** Wallet credits run INSIDE `BillingReceiptDao.grantOnceAtomic` — receipt flip + wallet write commit atomically. Play Services RPCs (`consumeAsync`, `acknowledgePurchaseAsync`) run AFTER the transaction, so the SQLite lock is never held across a Google round-trip. Failed consume/ack is retried by `retryUnresolvedConsumeOrAck()` on the next reconciliation sweep — wallet is NOT re-credited (the `granted = true` guard short-circuits). Pending purchases persist with `granted = false` and are promoted to PURCHASED on the next sweep.
- **5 ADR open questions resolved** (promoting ADR-0005 Proposed → Accepted): Q1 delegates to v8's `enableAutoServiceReconnection()`; Q2 orders consume/ack after grant-commit with retry-without-re-credit; Q3 uses real Play Console SKUs + license test accounts (no static test SKUs); Q4 marks subscription proration out of scope for v1.0; Q5 sets `obfuscatedAccountId` to SHA-256 of a device-local UUID stored in `SharedPreferences("billing_anti_fraud")`.
- **Tests: 488 → 510.** `BillingReceiptDaoTest` (7 tests, Robolectric + real in-memory Room): upsert/get round-trip, `getByToken` not-found, `grantOnceAtomic` flip + wallet-credit lambda ran exactly once, idempotency (second call returns false, wallet lambda NOT run, `grantedAt` from first call preserved), `markConsumed`/`markAcknowledged` target-only, `getGrantedButUnresolved` filter, `getAll` orders by `purchaseTime` DESC. `RoomSchemaTest` extended with billing_receipt round-trip touching every column (incl. 4 nullables). `BillingManagerImplTest` (14 tests, Robolectric + real in-memory Room + mockito-kotlin on adapter): 3 happy paths (GEM_PACK_SMALL + consume / AD_REMOVAL + ack / SEASON_PASS + 30-day expiry), 5 failure paths (user cancel, product unavailable, no activity, connect fails, pending purchase persists receipt without credit), idempotency (same `purchaseToken` → Success + no double-credit), 2 reconciliation cases (PENDING→PURCHASED transition grants exactly once across repeated sweeps; `retryUnresolvedConsumeOrAck` retries consume without re-crediting wallet), `isAdRemoved` / `isSeasonPassActive` delegation to `PlayerRepository`. `./run-gradle.sh test` = BUILD SUCCESSFUL.

### Phase A — Foundation (2026-05-07, all 9 PRs merged)
- **A.2** Added `junit-vintage-engine` to test classpath — recovered 9 previously-hidden Robolectric tests (`RoomSchemaTest`, `DeepLinkRoutingTest`, `StepWidgetProviderTest`). Each needed `@Config(sdk = [34], application = android.app.Application::class)` as a Robolectric 4.14.1 / compileSdk 36 workaround.
- **A.3** `DatabaseKeyManager` now deletes the on-disk DB file (plus -shm/-wal) when the passphrase blob fails to decrypt, preventing crash-on-launch loops after device restore.
- **A.6** `DailyStepManager.runFollowOnPipeline` now forwards `seasonPassActive` / `seasonPassExpiry` to `TrackDailyLogin`, so the +10 Gems/day Season Pass bonus is credited even when step ingestion runs from the worker or background service.
- **A.5** `Screen.fromRoute` + `argumentFreeRoutes` whitelist — deep-links now reach all 12 argument-free routes (previously: 4). Unknown routes fall through silently.
- **A.4** `FakeBillingManager` / `FakeRewardAdManager` gained `resultQueue` scripting, configurable `isAdRemoved`/`isSeasonPassActive`/`isAdAvailable`, and call-log history. Store / Cards ViewModel tests now exercise every `PurchaseResult` / `AdResult` variant.
- **A.7** Capped Battle Step kills no longer spawn a misleading "+N Step" FloatingText. Callback signature changed to `(amount, x, y)` and spawn responsibility moved from GameEngine into BattleViewModel's callback.
- **A.8** Removed dead `PlaceholderScreen` and 4 orphaned imports from `MainActivity.kt`.
- **A.9** Deleted unused `SupplyDropTrigger.STEP_BURST` enum entry (no producer, no Room rows, no tests). Commit body preserves the original notification copy.
- **A.1** Current-state docs synced to DB schema v8 and 453-test baseline.

### Phase B.1 — Core Refactoring (2026-05-07, TimeProvider narrow migration)
- **B.1 PR 1** Added `TimeProvider` interface in `domain/time/` with `now(): Instant` and `today(): LocalDate`. Production `SystemTimeProvider` in `data/time/`, Hilt wiring in `di/TimeModule.kt`.
- **B.1 PR 2** Migrated 3 date-reading sites to a `timeProvider` default-arg parameter: `AwardBattleSteps`, `BattleViewModel`, `MissionsViewModel`. ~50 other wall-clock sites left on the real clock by design — narrow migration, not a sweep.
- **B.1 PR 3** Added `FakeTimeProvider` and 2 midnight-boundary tests that were previously impossible to write against the real clock. BattleViewModel now propagates its `timeProvider` into the inline `AwardBattleSteps` construction so the abstraction is end-to-end.
- ADR-0004 FollowOnPipeline stub recorded (status: Proposed, upgrade to Accepted when B.4 PR 1 lands).

### Phase B.2 — RO-02 atomic multi-writes (2026-05-07, PRs 1–3 of 5)
- **B.2 PR 1** `PurchaseUpgrade` now commits through `WorkshopDao.purchaseUpgradeAtomic` — a suspend `@Transaction` default interface method that takes `PlayerProfileDao` as a param. SQL-guarded deduct `UPDATE … WHERE currentStepBalance >= :cost` plus the workshop-level upsert runs in a single SQLite transaction. Closes the partial-failure gap between `spendSteps` and `setUpgradeLevel` and the double-tap race where two concurrent purchases could both pass an in-memory affordability check and double-spend. `PurchaseUpgrade` dropped its `PlayerRepository` dep; body shrank to a single delegation. First `@Transaction` marker in `app/src/main`.
- **B.2 PR 2** `AwardBattleSteps` now commits through `DailyStepDao.creditBattleStepsAtomic` — same pattern as PR 1, cross-DAO `@Transaction` default method taking `PlayerProfileDao`. Cap check + `incrementBattleSteps` + `adjustStepBalance` wrapped atomically. Closes the partial-failure gap (wallet credited without cap counter advancing) and the concurrent-kill race (two kills with 1 headroom could overflow by 1). `AwardBattleSteps` dropped its `PlayerRepository` dep; `BattleViewModel` gained a Hilt-injected `PlayerProfileDao`.
- **B.2 PR 3** `StepCrossValidator` wraps its 5 multi-write branches (Level 3 / Level 2 cap-excess, Level 1 / Level 0 first-escrow, reconciliation release) in `AppDatabase.withTransaction { }`. Different idiom from PRs 1–2 (repo-level not DAO-level) because the validator lives in `data/healthconnect/` and needs parallel transaction scopes; RO-02 explicitly licenses the cross-layer `AppDatabase` import here. Introduced a test-friendly `@VisibleForTesting internal var runInTransaction` seam so existing Mockito-based tests keep working without a real Room DB. `SharedPreferences` anti-cheat writes (`recordCvOffense`, `decayCvOffenses`) deliberately stay outside the transaction (not SQLite-backed).
- **B.2 PRs 4–5 still pending:** `ClaimMilestone` atomic (same pattern as PRs 1–2) and the `runEndRoundPersistence` `@Transaction` wrap (single-call-site change thanks to B.3 PR 1).

### Phase B.3 PR 1 — Resilient `runEndRoundPersistence` (2026-05-07)
- Extracted `BattleViewModel.endRound` body into a private suspend `runEndRoundPersistence(eng, wave)`. Each of 5 writes + 1 notification is wrapped in its own `runCatching { }.onFailure { Log.w(TAG, "endRound: <writeName> failed", it) }` so a single Room / notification-manager exception can no longer leave the player on a frozen battle screen with no post-round overlay.
- Writes whose results feed `RoundEndState` (`updateBestWave` → isNewBestWave/previousBest, `awardWaveMilestone` → psAwarded, `checkTierUnlock` + `updateHighestUnlockedTier` → tierUnlocked) use `.getOrNull()` / `.getOrDefault(0)` fallbacks, so the `_uiState.update` push **always** runs — even when every write throws.
- Writes 4–5 (`incrementBattleStats`, `dailyMissionDao.updateProgress`) moved from ad-hoc `try / catch (_: Exception) { /* best-effort */ }` swallows to `runCatching + Log.w` for observability parity with the R2-07 `StepSyncWorker` precedent.
- `endRound()` shrank from ~35 lines to 6 (guard + null-check + `viewModelScope.launch { runEndRoundPersistence(eng, wave) }`). `quitRound()` and the polling-loop call site unchanged; `roundEnded` guard still dedupes.
- `FakePlayerRepository` opened up (`class` → `open class`; 4 write methods marked `open override`) so tests can inject per-method throwing overrides to exercise the failure-isolation paths.
- `onCleared` mid-navigation round-loss fix is deliberately deferred to B.3 PR 2 per the RO-03 spec.

### Phase B.2 PR 4 — Atomic @Transaction for ClaimMilestone (2026-05-08)
- **MilestoneDao** gained `claimMilestoneAtomic(milestoneId, gems, powerStones, claimedAt, playerDao)` — a suspend `@Transaction` default method. Read-modify-write pattern matches `DailyStepDao.creditBattleStepsAtomic`: check existing → bail if already claimed → `upsert(MilestoneEntity(claimed=true, claimedAt))` → credit gems + power stones via `playerDao.adjustGems` + `incrementGemsEarned` (and Power Stones equivalents) inside the tx. Closes the partial-failure gap between reward credits and the mark-claimed write, and the double-claim race where two concurrent clicks could both see `claimed=false` and both credit.
- **ClaimMilestone** use case: dep shape `(milestoneDao, playerRepository)` → `(milestoneDao, playerRepository, playerProfileDao)`. Still reads `totalStepsEarned` through `PlayerRepository` (monotonic read, safe outside the tx). Body shrank from reward-iteration loop + upsert to a single atomic delegation. `MilestoneReward.Cosmetic` still a no-op pending C.4 detection fix.
- **MissionsViewModel** gained a Hilt-injected `PlayerProfileDao`. **FakeMilestoneDao** gained optional `linkedPlayer: FakePlayerRepository? = null` + Mutex-guarded `claimMilestoneAtomic` override + `claimMilestoneAtomicCallCount` counter. Existing no-arg construction sites (CheckMilestonesTest, HomeViewModelTest) stay source-compatible.
- **ClaimMilestoneTest**: 5 → 8 cases (+3 RO-02 atomicity cases).

### Phase B.2 PR 5 — Room @Transaction around runEndRoundPersistence (2026-05-08, FINAL RO-02 site)
- **BattleViewModel.runEndRoundPersistence** now commits its 5 SQLite writes (`updateBestWave`, `awardWaveMilestone`, `updateHighestUnlockedTier`, `incrementBattleStats`, `dailyMissionDao.updateProgress`) inside a single `AppDatabase.withTransaction { }` block. External readers (Flow-based reactive reads) now see either the pre-PR state or the post-PR state, never a partial fan-out.
- Constructor grew to 12 params (+`AppDatabase`). Introduced `@VisibleForTesting internal var runInTransaction` seam matching `StepCrossValidator`'s B.2 PR 3 idiom — Mockito mocks of `AppDatabase` can't run Room's `withTransaction` extension, so tests override with a direct-invocation pass-through.
- Non-SQLite side effects (milestone notification, `_uiState.update`) moved to *after* the tx — no DB lock held across Android system calls or UI pushes.
- Outer `runCatching { runInTransaction { ... } }` preserves RO-03 resilience: Room infrastructure failures (disk full, SQLCipher decrypt failure) still let the post-round overlay appear with safe defaults (`isNewBestWave = false`, etc).
- **RO-02 family complete: 5/5 sites landed** (3 DAO-level `@Transaction` + 2 repo-level `withTransaction`).
- **BattleViewModelTest**: 19 → 21 cases (+2 atomicity cases: tx opened exactly once per round; UI push runs AFTER tx commits).

### Phase B.3 PR 2 — onCleared guard preserves mid-nav round progress (2026-05-08, FINAL RO-03 site)
- **New `di/CoroutineScopeModule.kt`** with `@ApplicationScope` qualifier + `@Singleton @Provides fun provideApplicationScope(): CoroutineScope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Default)`. Outlives VM cancellation — fire-and-forget work launched here completes even if the originating ViewModel is cleared mid-operation.
- **Deviation from RO-03 spec** (documented in the module's KDoc): spec suggested `ProcessLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope`, but (a) `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-process` isn't on the classpath, (b) its default dispatcher is `Dispatchers.Main` — wrong for DB writes, (c) Hilt-injected scope is more testable (`TestScope`-backed), (d) matches the project's Hilt-first conventions (BillingModule / AdModule / TimeModule precedent).
- **BattleViewModel**: +`@param:ApplicationScope applicationScope: CoroutineScope` (12 → 13 params). Extracted `markEndedAndLaunchPersistence(scope, eng)` helper that sets `roundEnded + roundOver` and launches `runEndRoundPersistence` on the provided scope; `endRound()` delegates via `viewModelScope`, new `onCleared()` override delegates via `applicationScope` when `engine != null && !roundEnded && engine.hasWaveProgress()`. Three-way guard prevents bounce-through phantom persistence and double-persistence on the normal `quitRound → onCleared` sequence.
- **GameEngine.hasWaveProgress()**: `elapsedTimeSeconds > 0f || totalEnemiesKilled > 0`. Thread-safe (reads `@Volatile` fields only).
- **RO-03 family complete: 2/2 sites landed** (B.3 PR 1 resilient extraction + B.3 PR 2 mid-nav scope guard).
- **BattleViewModelTest**: 21 → 24 cases (+3 B.3 PR 2 tests: mid-round onCleared persists, no-progress bounce-through is no-op, post-quitRound onCleared is no-op).
- Fixed the `@ApplicationScope` → `@param:ApplicationScope` forward-compat warning (Kotlin KT-73255) on the same PR for clean build.

### Phase C.2 PR 1 — Cosmetic renderer override pipeline (2026-05-08, RO-07 plumbing)
- **CosmeticItem** domain model: +`overrideColors: List<Int>? = null` nullable field. Pure Kotlin (no Android imports in domain). All existing construction sites stay source-compatible.
- **CosmeticRepositoryImpl**: +private `ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP: Map<String, List<Int>>` empty map + KDoc (first entry ships in C.2 PR 2 with ZIG_JADE). `toDomain` populates `overrideColors = ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP[cosmeticId]`. No DB schema change — colors are content, live in code.
- **GameEngine**: +`@Volatile var cosmeticOverrides: Map<CosmeticCategory, CosmeticItem> = emptyMap()` public property. In `init()`, selects `cosmeticOverrides[ZIGGURAT_SKIN]?.overrideColors ?: biomeTheme.zigguratColors` when constructing ZigguratEntity — null-coalesce guarantees no regression when no cosmetic equipped.
- **BattleViewModel** constructor grew to 14 params (+`CosmeticRepository`). Loads equipped cosmetics in the init launch (`cosmeticRepository.observeEquipped().first().associateBy { it.category }`) and pushes to `engine?.cosmeticOverrides` in TWO places: init-launch completion and `startPollingEngine` — idempotent double-push handles the load-vs-attach race; whichever fires last wins.
- Pure additive plumbing. No user-visible change until C.2 PR 2 seeds ZIG_JADE + removes the R2-11 "Coming Soon" guard for that single ID in StoreScreen.
- **BattleViewModelTest**: 24 → 26 cases (+2 C.2 PR 1 tests: empty equipped set stays empty on engine; equipped ZIGGURAT_SKIN cosmetic propagates to `engine.cosmeticOverrides`).

### Phase C.2 PR 2 — Seed zig_jade as first end-to-end cosmetic (2026-05-08, RO-07 content)
- **CosmeticRepositoryImpl**: `ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP` populated with its first entry — `"zig_jade"` mapped to the 5-color jade palette `[0xFF104E3C, 0xFF1A6B52, 0xFF2A8F6E, 0xFF3CAB82, 0xFF54C79A]` (bottom layer → top highlight). Matches the fixture used by the PR 1 synthetic VM→engine test.
- **SEED_COSMETICS**: +1 row — `CosmeticEntity(cosmeticId = "zig_jade", category = "ZIGGURAT_SKIN", name = "Jade Ziggurat", description = "Deep jade stone with pale highlights", priceGems = 150)`. Placed first in the list so it surfaces at the top of the Store cosmetics section. Total seed count: 7 → 8 (4 ZIGGURAT_SKIN, 2 PROJECTILE_EFFECT, 2 ENEMY_SKIN).
- **StoreScreen**: R2-11 "Coming Soon" guard lifted for `zig_jade` only via a new file-level `ENABLED_COSMETIC_ID` allow-list const. Unowned jade shows `💎 {priceGems}` on an enabled Button wired to `viewModel.purchaseCosmetic`, disabled while `state.isPurchasing` (double-tap guard). All other unowned cosmetics stay behind the existing "Coming Soon" disabled button until their palette ships in C.2 PR 3+. Disclaimer line updated: "Most cosmetic visuals are still being finalized. Jade Ziggurat is available now."
- **FakeCosmeticDao**: new in-memory fake (`test/fakes/`, 75 LOC) simulating Room's `@PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)` via a monotonic counter, plus per-cosmeticId upsert / equip / unequip / unequipCategory semantics matching the real DAO contract.
- **CosmeticRepositoryImplTest**: new (`test/data/repository/`, 134 LOC, 5 cases) proves the `seed → ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP → CosmeticItem.overrideColors` chain on the real impl — the last mile of the C.2 pipeline that PR 1's VM test could not cover with a fake repo. Cases: (1) `ensureSeedData` inserts `zig_jade` with correct metadata; (2) `zig_jade.overrideColors` matches the 5-color jade palette exactly (content-as-code contract); (3) other 7 seeds have `null` overrideColors (regression guard: lookup is selective, not blanket); (4) equipped `zig_jade` surfaces via `observeEquipped` with palette intact — repo-layer mirror of the PR 1 VM→engine test; (5) `ensureSeedData` idempotent on repeat call (documents the current all-or-nothing `dao.count() > 0` gate).
- **480 tests** (475 → 480 via the 5 new repo-layer cases). Zero balance-math changes.
- **Known debt flagged for release:** `ensureSeedData` currently short-circuits when `dao.count() > 0`, so future content PRs (C.2 PR 3+) that add new seed rows won't land on already-seeded installs without a data clear. Acceptable for pre-release; must be replaced with per-cosmeticId upsert logic (or a DB migration) before v1.0.

### Phase C.4 — ClaimMilestone UnknownCosmetic detection (2026-05-08, RO-07 follow-up)
- **ClaimMilestone**: return type `Boolean` → `ClaimMilestoneResult` sealed class with four variants — `Success` (atomic credit ran), `InsufficientSteps` (step threshold unmet), `AlreadyClaimed` (atomic DAO returned false), `UnknownCosmetic(cosmeticId)` (one of the milestone's `MilestoneReward.Cosmetic` ids has no matching row in `SEED_COSMETICS`). Pre-flight check runs BEFORE the atomic DAO call so no partial credit when a cosmetic id is unknown. Constructor grew to 4 params (+`CosmeticRepository`).
- **CosmeticRepository**: +`suspend fun idExists(cosmeticId: String): Boolean` on the domain interface. Real impl lazy-seeds via `ensureSeedData()` then queries `observeAll().first().any { it.cosmeticId == cosmeticId }`; `FakeCosmeticRepository` checks its `items` StateFlow directly. KDoc on the interface documents the C.4 detection-only rationale and flags resolution as C.2 PR 3+ content work.
- **MissionsViewModel**: gained a Hilt-injected `CosmeticRepository` (7 constructor params). `claimMilestone(milestone)` now pattern-matches `ClaimMilestoneResult` and surfaces non-Success outcomes as user-visible snackbar messages via a new `userMessage: StateFlow<String?>` + `clearMessage()` method. The `combine()` grew from 4 to 5 flows (+userMessage). `MissionsUiState` gained `userMessage: String?` field with KDoc.
- **MissionsScreen**: wrapped in `Scaffold(snackbarHost = { SnackbarHost(…) })` with a `LaunchedEffect(state.userMessage)` that shows the snackbar and clears. First time Missions gets user feedback on failed claims (previously silent).
- **User-visible impact today:** the 3 currently-mismatched milestone cosmetic ids (`garden_ziggurat_skin` on MARATHON_WALKER, `lapis_lazuli_skin` on IRON_SOLES, `sandals_of_gilgamesh` on GLOBE_TROTTER) now surface as a snackbar ("Reward temporarily unavailable …") instead of silently dropping. Those 3 milestones cannot be claimed until C.2 PR 3+ adds matching seed rows; until then the claim rejects cleanly with zero partial credit.
- **ClaimMilestoneTest**: 8 → 12 cases (-1 merged + 5 new). Removed the old `credits Gems and Power Stones for IRON_SOLES` success-path case; coverage preserved by (a) new `UnknownCosmetic surfaces offending cosmetic id for IRON_SOLES` (default-state UnknownCosmetic rejection) + (b) new `milestone with matching cosmetic id credits rewards via atomic path` (seeds a `lapis_lazuli_skin` cosmetic fixture and shows the atomic credit runs cleanly, emulating post-C.2-PR-3 state). Renamed 3 cases for Result-type clarity. Switched the concurrent-claims race target from IRON_SOLES (unknown cosmetic) to MORNING_JOGGER (Gems-only) so the atomicity invariant being tested is independent of the cosmetic-id pre-flight check. 4 new C.4 cases: `UnknownCosmetic` x 3 (one per mismatched milestone, asserting the exact offending id), `UnknownCosmetic rejects claim before the atomic DAO call with no credit` (regression guard on the pre-flight ordering).
- **MissionsViewModelTest**: direct `ClaimMilestone` construction updated to 4-arg (+`FakeCosmeticRepository()`); asserts `ClaimMilestoneResult.Success` on the FIRST_STEPS claim path.
- **484 tests** (480 → 484 via +4 net). Zero balance-math changes.

### Fix — `ensureSeedData` per-cosmeticId filter (2026-05-08)
- **CosmeticRepositoryImpl.ensureSeedData**: replaced the all-or-nothing `if (dao.count() > 0) return` short-circuit with a per-`cosmeticId` filter. Reads existing ids once via `observeAll().first().mapTo(HashSet())`, computes `missing = SEED_COSMETICS.filter { it.cosmeticId !in existingIds }`, and `upsertAll(missing)` only when non-empty. Three behaviours:
  - **Fresh install:** `existingIds` empty → every SEED_COSMETICS row inserted. Identical to pre-fix behaviour.
  - **Partial-catalogue upgrade:** device already has the pre-`zig_jade` 7-row catalogue → only `zig_jade` inserted; 7 legacy rows untouched. Before the fix, this case was broken (count > 0 short-circuit skipped everything), so `zig_jade` never landed on already-installed devs without a data clear.
  - **Steady state:** all ids present → `missing` empty → no DAO write. Same as before, different mechanism.
- **Why the filter instead of a universal upsert:** `CosmeticEntity`'s primary key is `id` (auto-gen), not `cosmeticId`. Re-upserting a seed row with `id = 0` would insert a new auto-gen row alongside the existing one, not replace it. The explicit filter sidesteps that entirely by never handing already-present rows to the DAO.
- **Unblocks C.2 PR 3+** (the 3 milestone cosmetic seed rows that resolve the C.4 UnknownCosmetic detections): content PRs can now land on any install regardless of its catalogue history. Also removes the "data clear required" friction for any dev who installed a pre-C.2-PR-2 debug build.
- **Tests:** CosmeticRepositoryImplTest gained 2 regression-guard cases:
  - `ensureSeedData inserts newly-added rows on partial catalogue upgrade` — pre-seeds 7 legacy rows manually (no `zig_jade`), asserts `ensureSeedData` inserts `zig_jade` with its `ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP` palette and leaves the 7 legacy rows intact.
  - `ensureSeedData preserves player state on existing rows (isOwned, isEquipped)` — pre-seeds `zig_jade` with `isOwned=true, isEquipped=true`, runs `ensureSeedData`, asserts the player state survives (never overwritten because the filter skips the row entirely).
  Existing idempotency test renamed (removed "count gate holds" phrase); end-state assertion unchanged because the filter produces the same steady-state behaviour via a different mechanism.
- **486 tests** (484 → 486). Zero balance-math changes.

### Phase C.2 PR 3 — Seed `lapis_lazuli_skin` (IRON_SOLES milestone reward) (2026-05-08)
- **CosmeticRepositoryImpl.SEED_COSMETICS**: +1 row — `CosmeticEntity(cosmeticId = "lapis_lazuli_skin", category = "ZIGGURAT_SKIN", name = "Lapis Lazuli Ziggurat Skin", description = "Deep lapis lazuli stone with pyrite-gold flecks", priceGems = 500)`. Placed second in the list (directly after `zig_jade`) so the two palette-shipping cosmetics appear grouped at the top of the Store section. Intentionally NOT added to `StoreScreen.ENABLED_COSMETIC_ID` — still shows "Coming Soon" in the Store; primary acquisition path is the IRON_SOLES milestone claim. Store pricing is a future UX decision. Total seed count: 8 → 9.
- **ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP**: +1 entry — `"lapis_lazuli_skin"` maps to `[0xFF1A1F5C, 0xFF2A3880, 0xFF3B4FAB, 0xFF4F68C8, 0xFFD4A84A]` (bottom → top: deep lapis base → bright lapis → pyrite-gold crown). The gold crown is the traditional pyrite-fleck reference that distinguishes lapis lazuli from plain blue stone. Same 5-int / layer-ordered contract as the `zig_jade` palette (C.2 PR 2).
- **Resolves C.4 UnknownCosmetic for IRON_SOLES**: `CosmeticRepository.idExists("lapis_lazuli_skin")` now returns `true`, so `ClaimMilestone(Milestone.IRON_SOLES)` passes the pre-flight cosmetic-id check and runs the atomic credit (200 Gems + 50 Power Stones). Before this PR, IRON_SOLES claims returned `UnknownCosmetic("lapis_lazuli_skin")` and rejected cleanly; post-PR, they return `Success`.
- **ClaimMilestoneTest**: rewired 12 → 11 cases. Removed `UnknownCosmetic surfaces offending cosmetic id for IRON_SOLES` (prod semantics flipped — lapis_lazuli_skin is now seeded, IRON_SOLES no longer returns UnknownCosmetic). Switched `UnknownCosmetic rejects claim before the atomic DAO call with no credit` to target MARATHON_WALKER (garden_ziggurat_skin still unknown) so the test reflects prod behaviour. Rewrote the former `milestone with matching cosmetic id credits rewards via atomic path` as `IRON_SOLES claim succeeds end-to-end via real CosmeticRepositoryImpl` — uses `CosmeticRepositoryImpl(FakeCosmeticDao())` instead of a `FakeCosmeticRepository` fixture, proving the full `SEED_COSMETICS → ensureSeedData → idExists → ClaimMilestone atomic credit → wallet` chain on the real implementation.
- **CosmeticRepositoryImplTest**: updated 7 → 8 cases. +1 new `C2PR3 - lapis_lazuli_skin propagates lapis palette via overrideColors from ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP` with exact-value palette assertion matching the `zig_jade` pattern (content-as-code contract). Updated `ensureSeedData is idempotent` count assertion 8 → 9. Updated `ensureSeedData inserts newly-added rows on partial catalogue upgrade` count 8 → 9 with a new lapis palette check alongside the existing jade one (proves both palettes land on the same upgrade path). Updated `ensureSeedData preserves player state on existing rows` count 8 → 9. Updated the `other seeded ziggurat cosmetics have null overrideColors` comment to reflect that both `zig_jade` (PR 2) and `lapis_lazuli_skin` (PR 3) now ship palettes.
- **486 tests, unchanged count** (-1 ClaimMilestoneTest removed case + 1 CosmeticRepositoryImplTest new lapis palette case = 0 net). Zero balance-math changes.
- **Next up (C.2 PR 3b / 3c):** `garden_ziggurat_skin` (MARATHON_WALKER, 600 Gems) and `sandals_of_gilgamesh` (GLOBE_TROTTER, 500 Gems). Each PR will flip one more `UnknownCosmetic` detection to `Success`. After all 3 land, all 6 Milestone entries are fully claimable end-to-end — closes the "shipped but disabled" monetization gap that has been tracked since Plan R2-11.

### Phase C.2 PR 3b + 3c — Seed remaining milestone cosmetics (MARATHON_WALKER + GLOBE_TROTTER) (2026-05-08)
- **CosmeticRepositoryImpl.SEED_COSMETICS**: +2 rows — `garden_ziggurat_skin` (ZIGGURAT_SKIN, 600 Gems, MARATHON_WALKER reward) and `sandals_of_gilgamesh` (ZIGGURAT_SKIN, 500 Gems, GLOBE_TROTTER reward). Total seed count: 9 → 11. Both placed directly after `lapis_lazuli_skin` so the 4 palette-shipping cosmetics appear as a block at the top of the catalogue. Neither is in `StoreScreen.ENABLED_COSMETIC_ID` — both are milestone-acquisition-only, still show "Coming Soon" in the Store.
- **ZIGGURAT_COLOR_LOOKUP**: +2 palettes.
  - `garden_ziggurat_skin`: `[0xFF8B4726, 0xFFAD7B4C, 0xFF5E7F47, 0xFF7BA85A, 0xFFE0C890]` — Hanging Gardens biome theme. Terracotta ziggurat base → sun-bleached sandstone → mossy vines → lush foliage → pale bloom canopy. Evokes the stone structure overtaken by cascading gardens.
  - `sandals_of_gilgamesh`: `[0xFF3B2A1A, 0xFF6B4A2A, 0xFF8B6B42, 0xFFB89152, 0xFFE8C068]` — weathered bronze → polished bronze → gold crown. Heroic motif; the gold crown echoes `lapis_lazuli_skin` as a shared "legendary" visual cue.
- **Category decision for `sandals_of_gilgamesh`:** the id carries footwear semantics ("walking the edges of the world") but the cosmetic is implemented as a `ZIGGURAT_SKIN` — a bronze Gilgamesh-themed ziggurat variant. Kept the existing category + pipeline intact (no new `CosmeticCategory` enum value, no schema change, no new rendering path). Description text ("Bronze ziggurat in honour of Gilgamesh, whose sandals walked the edges of the world") bridges the name-vs-implementation gap. Revisit a `PLAYER_AVATAR` category only if future milestones introduce multiple player-avatar cosmetics.
- **Resolves the remaining 2 C.4 UnknownCosmetic detections**: `ClaimMilestone(MARATHON_WALKER)` now returns `Success` (600 Gems credited); `ClaimMilestone(GLOBE_TROTTER)` now returns `Success` (500 Gems credited). Combined with C.2 PR 3 (IRON_SOLES), all 3 previously-mismatched milestone cosmetic ids are fixed. **All 6 Milestone entries now claim cleanly end-to-end.**
- **ClaimMilestoneTest**: 11 → 11 cases (net 0: -2 + 2). Removed both `UnknownCosmetic surfaces offending cosmetic id for MARATHON_WALKER` and `... for GLOBE_TROTTER` (prod semantics flipped to Success for both). Kept the `UnknownCosmetic rejects claim before the atomic DAO call with no credit` synthetic regression guard (still uses MARATHON_WALKER against the empty fake — no prod Milestone currently reaches this rejection path, but the guard protects against future content work introducing a new Milestone with an unseeded Cosmetic reward). Setup comment rewritten to reflect: no more prod mismatches. Added `MARATHON_WALKER claim succeeds end-to-end via real CosmeticRepositoryImpl` + `GLOBE_TROTTER claim succeeds end-to-end via real CosmeticRepositoryImpl` — same shape as the existing IRON_SOLES test. Together with the IRON_SOLES test, every Milestone with a Cosmetic reward has a dedicated end-to-end success test.
- **CosmeticRepositoryImplTest**: 8 → 10 cases (+2). Added `C2PR3b - garden_ziggurat_skin propagates hanging-gardens palette` + `C2PR3c - sandals_of_gilgamesh propagates bronze-ziggurat palette`, each with exact-value palette assertion matching the `zig_jade` / `lapis_lazuli_skin` pattern (content-as-code contract). Updated all 3 count assertions (9 → 11): idempotency, partial-catalogue upgrade (now verifies all 4 palette-shipping cosmetics land correctly on the same upgrade path), existing-row preservation. Updated the `other seeded ziggurat cosmetics have null overrideColors` comment to list all 4 palette cosmetics.
- **488 tests** (486 → 488 via +2 net). Zero balance-math changes.
- **Monetization gap closed.** The RO-07 "shipped but disabled" cosmetic gap that has been tracked since Plan R2-11 is fully resolved: renderer pipeline live (C.2 PR 1), first store cosmetic live (C.2 PR 2 `zig_jade`), all 3 milestone cosmetics live (C.2 PR 3 / 3b / 3c), UnknownCosmetic detection still guards against regressions (C.4), `ensureSeedData` lands new rows on any install (fix). Players who hit IRON_SOLES / MARATHON_WALKER / GLOBE_TROTTER now get their full rewards atomically.

### Current state
- **531 JVM tests** green (412 baseline → 488 after C.2 PR 3b+3c → 510 after C.5 PR 1 → 514 after C.5 PR 2 → 522 after C.6 PR 1 → 526 after C.6 PR 2 → 531 after the battle-step-credit hotfix). Zero balance-math changes across all of Phase B, Phase C, and the hotfix.
- Plan 31 (Play Console & Store Publication) remains the only release-blocker; unblocked since the end of Plan R2.
- **RO-02 complete: 5/5 atomic sites landed** (`PurchaseUpgrade`, `AwardBattleSteps`, `StepCrossValidator`, `ClaimMilestone`, `runEndRoundPersistence`).
- **RO-03 complete: 2/2 resilience sites landed** (extraction + `onCleared` guard).
- **RO-07 complete for the milestone-cosmetic gap: C.2 PRs 1+2+3+3b+3c + C.4 + ensureSeedData fix landed.** All 6 Milestone entries claim cleanly end-to-end. Only 3 of 7 seeded ziggurat skins ship palettes (the 3 milestone rewards + `zig_jade`); the 3 original placeholder skins (`zig_obsidian`, `zig_crystal`, `zig_golden`) + 4 non-ziggurat seeds (`proj_*`, `enemy_*`) remain "Coming Soon" in the Store until their visual content is designed.
- Real Billing/Ad SDK swaps (Phase C.5/C.6) still gated on ADR-0005/ADR-0006 — now the top release-critical item.
- B.4 (FollowOnPipeline extraction) + B.5 (UpdateMissionProgress use case) remain as pure debt, not release blockers.
