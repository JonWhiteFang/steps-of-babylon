name: backup-to-vault
description: Back up the repo's gitignored essentials (release keystore, signing passwords, AdMob IDs, run-gradle.sh) and full documentation set to the developer's Obsidian vault — secrets age-encrypted into one bundle, docs rsync-mirrored. Run when the developer says "backup to vault", "back up to obsidian", "sync to my vault", or wants a disaster-recovery / fresh-machine copy of the project essentials.

# /backup-to-vault — Mirror repo essentials to the Obsidian vault

User-invoked only (it writes outside the repo, into a cloud-synced vault). This skill captures the
things `git clone` will NOT give you on a fresh machine — the gitignored secrets and build helper —
plus a full documentation snapshot for offline reading in Obsidian. The tracked source code is
already on GitHub and is deliberately NOT copied.

**Reference design:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-24-backup-to-vault-skill-design.md`.

## Mental model

- **Vault target:** `/Users/jpawhite/Documents/kn0ck3r-vault/Claude/steps-of-babylon`
- **Secrets** are packed into one tar and encrypted with `age` (passphrase mode) → `secrets.enc`.
  The vault holds only ciphertext + a manifest of filenames (never values).
- **Docs** are rsync-mirrored (`--delete`, so the vault tracks the repo exactly).
- **Passphrase isolation:** Claude must NEVER see or type the passphrase — the transcript itself may
  sync. The developer runs the `age` step via the `! ` prompt prefix. Claude only stages, verifies,
  and cleans up.
- **Re-run behavior:** mirror mode — each run refreshes docs and regenerates the bundle + generated
  docs. No timestamped snapshots, no cron, not part of the PR doc-sweep.
